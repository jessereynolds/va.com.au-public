HOW THE tcp.smtp rules work with vpopmail courier-imap and tcpserver.<br> 
<br><br>
vpopmail, courier-imap and tcpserver use tcprules to determine if a SMTP<br> 
server/client can send mail to us or rely through us.<br>

well actually tcpserver does, vpopmail and courier-imap update the file for<br> 
clients that have successfully authenticated either an imap, imapssl, pop3 <br>
or pop3ssl login.<br>
vpopmail and courier-imap both update the file /usr/local/vpopmail/etc/open-smtp<br>
there is a mechanism within vpopmail that updates the tcprules from this file<br>
and tcp.smtp file (which is located in the same directory.) tcp.smtp file is not<br>
edited by any application and is present so permanant additions can be made <br>
to the rules.<br>
<br><br>
the open-smtp file is flushed every hour by a script called by cron and <br>
all clients that have not authenticated within this time are once again<br> 
not allowed relay.<br>
<br><br>
the line from crontab is:<br> 
2 * * * * /usr/local/vpopmail/bin/clearopensmtp 2>&1 >/dev/null<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
