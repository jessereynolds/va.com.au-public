<p><b>
1/ What is the VCe?
</b></p>
<p>
The Virtual Community Engine is a webserver extension that provides dynamic information based on a visitor¹s identity and associations with other people, places and things.  It is a framework for the management of complex inter-relationships, with options for integrated reviews, preferences, performance and event timetables, reviews, and related media that have been developed in real world conditions.
</p>
<p>
The VCe offers complete Web based content control so that you and the members of the website can keep your information up to date remotely using a GUI environment.
</p>

<p><b>
2/ What can I use the VCe for?
</b></p>
<p>
Events:  <br>
The VCe has been installed for a wide range of clients and applications, such as the Adelaide and Melbourne Fringe as the overall co-ordinating internet presence for these massive events. Logistically, a festival is possibly the Œworst-case¹ scenario for a web presence: multiple authors of unknown skill levels, a high public profile, timetables and facts that can change by the hour, as well as having the expectation that all parties should be able to collaborate.  Daily gossip pages were contributed to by multiple Local Arts insiders, the built in Recommendation Agents worked out what shows were still available you might like.  The 1996 Adelaide Cyberfringe won an NII Next Generation Award.  The Events framework serves as the basis for the new Arts Around Adelaide website. A "what's on" directory where AAA Member organisations can maintain their events and performance information, regular visitors can record event opinions, write reviews and flexibly search for events.
</p>
<p>
This framework can be adapted to suit most types of  festival, large or small, conferences and online event or performance scenarios such as gig guides and TV guides.
</p>
<p>
Distributed Organisations:  <br>
The VCE has been developed to suit the needs of large organisations or associations where members may not all be in close physical contact, but everyone requires both current, validated information about the organisation and plays a role in the overall net presence. Satisfac Direct Credit Union was the first to benefit from the Distributed Organisational Framework.  Features of the DOF are: two-to-sign validation and editing of services, service types, newsletters, staff, members, etc.  All the tools they need to maintain the site are built in, with no HTML required. 
</p>
<p>
The Distributed Organisation framework would suit members-based organisations of any kind, such as: Industry Associations, Trade Unions, Universities, lobby groups, political parties, corporations and small businesses.
</p>
<p>
The Zine-Engine:  <br>
The Zine Engine is a framework for online Magazine publishing.  Writers, artists, layout, editorial teams use the website to submit material (stories, photos, video, audio, shochwave, VRML, etc), compose and edit articles, schedule and layout using sets of intelligent templates.  It enables the user to automatically generate tables of contents, cover page, cross references, email notices, and archives. The classifications of story categories, member groups and so on can all be customised as needed.  All site administration down to the page editing level is through a web-form interface. Rendering agents operate in the background following the VCE Scheduler and render files to a remote server, thus reducing the load on the database server.
</p>
<p>
This framework would suit any mid- to large-scale online news, entertainment or publishing framework, from a student newspaper online to an international news service.
</p>
<p>
New VCE frameworks are being developed all the time.  In development  are framework for Schools modelled on the Distributed Organisation Framework, and a framework for realtime video schduling based on the Zine engine framework.
</p>
<p>
<b>
3/ What is the difference between the VCe and an ordinary website?
</b>
</p>
<p>
An ordinary web site is simply a collection of static HTML documents.  A Virtual Community engine takes advantage of the dynamics of human interaction and turns your website into a living entity; your members, visitors, readers and clients all become part of the site, and interactions are possible at many levels.  Many people and organisations believe that a website is simply a fancy brochure with animation, sound and hyperlinks; the VCE provides a framework for your information and allows you to develop sites which respond to your visitors in a context-sensitive manner.  Think of the site you really want to build as a full grown ivy; the VCe is the lattice upon which that ivy can grow.
</p>

<p><b>
4/ What type of server does the VCe need to be run on?
</b></p>
<p>
A site hosting the VCe runs on two servers - one to host the VCe itself and deal with all the 'live' requests on the site, and a second to deal with everything else. At the moment the VCe component of the site must be hosted on a Macintosh server, however we are currently working on porting it to Windows NT. We aim to complete this by the end of this year. It has not been done sooner because we have had no client request it. However we do see it as a good improvement to the product and could discuss pushing it through sooner if it was a major consideration. There would also be the option of hosting it initially on a Macintosh and then moving it over to Windows once the conversion was complete. The second server does not need to be anything in particular, indeed, any FTP server would be suitable.<br>
The VCE runs in partnership with your existing webserver, and can run as a plugin under WebStar and WebTen.
</p>

<p><b>
5/ Where has the VCe already been used?
</b></p>
<p>
The VCe, in various incarnations, has been installed for a wide range of clients and applications. Currently it is powering sites such as:
</p>
<p>
noise - <a href="http://www.noise.net.au">http://www.noise.net.au</a><br>
Adelaide Fringe Festival - <a href="http://www.adelaidefringe.com.au">http://www.adelaidefringe.com.au</a><br>
Learnscope - <a href="http://learnscope.anta.gov.au">http://www.learnscope.anta.gov.au</a><br>
screenarts - <a href="http://www.screenarts.net.au">http://www.screenarts.net.au</a><br>
</p>

<p><b>
6/ Is there a VCML editor?
</b></p>
<p>
Yes, the web site itself is the editor. There is a page within each VCe site that allows changes to be made accross the site as a whole. This is, in fact, the VCML editing environment. There is no specific GUI, and as such, any editing interface can be taylored to the needs of individual clients.
</p>

<p><b>
7/ Can the VCe support an icon or graphics database?
</b></p>
<p>
Yes. Infact files of any format can be uploaded to a VCe site - these can include graphics, video or sound files. However the VCe does not actually hold these files in the main data file itself. What it does do is to manage where the files are on the disk which, in effect, achieves the same results. This is more efficient as it means the database data file doesn't get unmanageably big, and means the VCe can FTP these graphic files to the front end web servers (on UNIX or NT). It can be configured such that either all members have the ability to upload media files, or just members of specific groups.
</p>

<p><b>
8/ Can the VCe support a bulletin board discussion format?
</b></p>
<p>
Yes. Although the VCe is not really designed for this, it can do it. Sometimes we build forums into the VCe and at other times we have attached a third party forum engine/threaded discussion forum. It all depends on exactly what the client wants to be able to achieve from the forum and what parameters are the most desired or appropriate.
</p>

<p><b>
9/ Can the VCe support a chat service?
</b></p>
<p>
Yes, the VCe can support a chat service. The VCe does not provide the core functionality of the chat service itself, rather it works in tandem with a third party chat product. Virtual Artists have a chat server, running Biap Chat (java and telnet clients available), and we could set up a VCe page that calls up the Biap Chat applet and connects to a specific room. There are other options for this too which include other third party chat servers that we can licence if Biap Chat is not appropriate, as well as free, web-based options. These involve havving a link from your site to a web site that will host your chat for free. The draw-back to this is that they will be able to put advertising on your site in return for the free chat hosting.
</p>

<p><b>
10/ Is there much VCML scripting to learn?
</b></p>
<p>
Well, yes, there is a fair bit - approximately 150 - 200 new tags. However, anyone with knowledge of HTML or data bases and scripting, (and preferably a good head for program design), should be able to pick it up relatively easily and quickly. As you are aware, the VCe can be customised for each new client. Usually Virtual Artists will either do all this customisation and the programming ourselves, or with a client 'understudy/student' who would be able to take over the work in time, as well as being able to maintain the site once it is up and running. We are also able to set up specific VCML training, if this is a more desirable format for the client. Whichever for is used is entirely up to the client.
</p>

<p><b>
11/ How, exactly, does the idea of 'groups' work in the VCe
</b></p>
<p>
The idea of 'groups' in the VCe work just like classic UNIX style users and
groups permissions.<br>
Every table in the VCe database has the following permissions fields:
</p>
<p>
owner (relates to the members table)<br>
group (relates to the groups table)<br>
owner_read (boolean flag)<br>
owner_write (boolean flag)<br>
group_read (boolean flag)<br>
group_write (boolean flag)<br>
other_read (boolean flag)<br>
other_write (boolean flag)<br>
</p>
<p>
This basic structure allows arbitrary permissions to be set up, and arbitrary work flows to be created. Members have one Primary Group, and a list of Secondary Groups. what items in the database they can edit, depends on which groups they are in and, of course, depending on the item's group, group_read and group_write flags. Of course it also depends upon the owner_read/write and other_read/write as well.
</p>
<p><b>
12/ How much does the VCe cost?
</b></p>
<p>
The VCe can be licenced in its current form for commercial and non commercial applications.  Commercial licences are $10,000.  Non commercial licence fees vary and you should get in touch with us directly at va@va.com.au.  Each VCe comes with a default set of templates and simple installation instructions.  Virtual Artists can provide further templates and training as required.
</p>
<p>
Virtual Artists are committed to development of the VCe to suit real world applications.  If you are not a developer but feel that your organisation, club, association, school or dream could benefit from an implementation of the VCE, we would love to talk to you. 
</p>
<p>
Projects developed using the VCe are costed on a project-by-project basis.
</p>

<p><b>
13/ Who produced the VCe?
</b></p>
<p>
The VCe was developed by Virtual Artists as an internal web/database tool  which provided the back end for their implementation of the 1995 Melbourne Cyberfringe.   Its modular design allowed VA to produce the highly complex, award winning 1996 Adelaide Cyberfringe in record time.  The core engine was fundamentally overhauled for the Arts Around Adelaide website in 1996/97 and additional frameworks were developed for Satisfac Direct Credit Union and LOUD Online.  The VCe is © Virtual Artists Pty Ltd
