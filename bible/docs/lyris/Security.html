<h2>     Security<p>
</h2>(optional) Defines the level of security regarding new members joining this mailing list.  The possible choices are:<p>
1) <I>open </I>- anyone can join (no approval needed) <br>2) <I>private </I>- administrator must approve new members <br>3) <I>password </I>- new members need to know the 
password to join <br>4) <I>closed </I>- only an administrator can add new members 
</I><p>
An <I>Open</I> mailing list means that anyone who finds this mailing list can request to join (either by email or using the Lyris Web Interface) and they will be immediately and automatically 
approved.  After joining, they will have full member status. 
</I><p>
A <I>Private</I> mailing list means that anyone who finds this mailing list can request to join (either by email or using the Lyris Web Interface) but they will not be automatically approved.  A 
List Administrator will have to approve their request to join before the person becomes a member.  List Administrators who have their settings defined to receive <I>Admin Mail </I>will receive an 
email notice when a person requests to join a <I>Private </I>mailing list. 
</I><p>
A <I>Password</I> protected mailing list means that anyone who finds this mailing list can request to join (either by email or using the Lyris Web Interface) , and will be automatically approved 
only if they know the password.  If they do not know the  password, they will be automatically rejected.  The password is defined in a field further down this page.  For subscription requests that 
arrive via email, the password is entered at the end of the subscription request, as in:  <br><I>subscribe jazz-discuss open-sesame 
</I><p>
<i></I>A <I>Closed</I> mailing list is one in which non-members are not able to apply for membership.  If a request for membership arrives by email, it will be automatically denied. On the Lyris Web 
Interface, the Join button will not be a choice on the Enter Mailing List page.  New members to a Closed mailing list must be added by the List Administrator. 
</I><p>
Note: you can change the Security status of a mailing list at any time.  For instance, you can start out as an Open mailing list (so that anyone can join), and then become a Private mailing list (so 
that new members must be approved by a List Administrator).
