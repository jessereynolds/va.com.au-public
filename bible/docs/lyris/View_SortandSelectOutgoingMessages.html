<h2>     View, Sort and Select Outgoing Messages<p>
</h2>Most Lyris servers send a large amount of outgoing mail, most of which are user requests to join or leave mailing lists.  For this reason, Lyris provides a number of ways to filter, 
sort and display the outgoing mail so that you can find the mail you are looking for. 
<p>
The top of the Outgoing Mail page has the following selections available:<p>
<B>Show What Messages <br></B>This allows you to select which incoming mail messages you want to view.  The choices are:</B><p>
* <I>show all postings  </I>-- selects all outgoing mail messages which are to be delivered, or have been delivered to mailing list members</I><p>
* <I>show all pending postings  </I>-- selects all outgoing mail messages which are currently in a state of being delivered.</I><p>
* <I>show all sent postings  </I>-- selects all outgoing mail messages which have been delivered to mailing list members</I><p>
* <I>show all unsent postings  </I>-- selects all outgoing mail messages which have not yet been completely delivered to mailing list members. Some message deliveries may have not been attempted at 
all ("new" status), while others have been mostly delivered, but a few recipients of the list had trouble receiving the message, so it must be retried for them ("retry" status) 
</I><p>
* <I>show all messages  </I>-- selects all outgoing mail messages</I><p>
* <I>listname: unsent postings</I> -- selects all outgoing mail messages which are postings to the given mailing list, and have not yet been completely delivered.  Some message deliveries may have 
not been attempted at all ("new" status), while others have been mostly delivered, but a few recipients of the list had trouble receiving the message, so it must be retried for them ("retry" status) 
</I><p>
* <I>listname: sent postings</I> -- selects all outgoing mail messages which are postings to the given mailing list, and have been completely delivered.  </I><p>
* <I>listname: pending postings</I> -- selects all outgoing mail messages which are postings to the given mailing list, and are currently in a state of being delivered.</I><p>
* <I>listname: all postings</I> -- selects all outgoing mail messages which are postings to the given mailing list, regardless of their delivery status.</I><p>
* <I>listname: all messages </I> -- selects all outgoing mail messages related to the given mailing list.</I><p>
Note that if you are viewing this web page as a list administrator, that the "Show What Messages" option will only display the listname:ZZZZ options for your mailing list, and will not allow you to 
see the other kinds of messages. 
<p>
<B>Show up to XXX messages</B> <br>This allows you to select how many messages you want to display at once.  Lyris always loads the newest messages first.  Because many administrators 
connect over the Internet, they may not want to have to wait to download a large HTML page listing hundreds of messages. Also, some web browsers will crash if the HTML page is too large.  This option 
allows you to select how many messages to show at once. 
</B><p>
<B>Sort by XXX</B> <br>This allows you to select how you want the mail messages sorted on your display. You can sort by any of the displayed fields.  The values for the sorted column will 
appear in a slightly darker shade of grey to indicate that they are being sorted. 
</B><p>
<B>Show Button</B> <br>This button will reload the Incoming Mail mail, displaying the mail according to the display options you selected.</B><p>
<B>View Selected Message</B> <br>This button will bring up a new web interface page that will display the selected message in its entirety, along with any informational fields for that 
message.
