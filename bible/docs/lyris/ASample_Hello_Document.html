<h3>A Sample "Hello" Document</h3>
The following document is an example of an extensive "hello" document that you might want mailed to new members of your mailing list.  <p>
This is a real document, used by the "Rhapsody" mailing list.  It is reprinted here by permission of the author, Vince Sabio.<p>
******************************************************************** <br>*                PLEASE SAVE THIS WELCOME MESSAGE!                 * 
<br>******************************************************************** <br> <br>Welcome to the Rhapsody Discussion List ... <br> <br>The purpose of this 
list is to provide an open forum for the posting <br>and discussion of news and information relating to the Rhapsody operating <br>system. That means that ANYTHING Rhapsody related 
is fair game. However, <br>if you have something that is not somehow related to Rhapsody -- for <br>example, Apple's stock increased by two points -- it would be better to 
<br>post it to one of the more general Macintosh-related forums; subscription <br>information for two of them is provided below. <br> <br>Commercial announcements 
are allowed and encouraged, but please follow <br>the guidelines listed in the Posting section of the Rhapsody Discussion <br>List FAQ (see item 6 below), or on the web at 
<br>&lt;http://user.icx.net/~bgiles/rhapsody/posting.html&gt;. <br> <br>This list is hosted on a Lyris mailing list server, provided to us by <br>Shelby Group, Ltd. As 
such, we are guests on this server, <br>and a level of decorum commensurate with our status as guests will be <br>enforced on this list. Please keep discussion civil and 
constructive, <br>and take heated discussions and non-constructive comments off the list. <br>Failure to do so will result in the subscribers' posting privileges <br>being 
revoked by the listmoms for a "cooling off period." <br> <br>The listmoms for the Rhapsody Discussion List are: <br> <br>  Bruce Giles   &lt;bgiles@icx.net&gt; 
<br>  Randy Meadows &lt;rmeadows@fgm.com&gt; <br>  Vince Sabio   &lt;listmom@telephonet.com&gt; (list owner) <br> <br>  To send a message to all three listmoms at once, 
<br>  use the address &lt;rhapsody-owner@clio.lyris.net&gt;. <br> <br>Please feel free to contact any of us with questions regarding the <br>Rhapsody Discussion List, or 
if you experience any problems with the <br>server. <br> <br>Just so that you have all the commands neatly contained in one place, <br>here is just about 
everything you will need to know. Note that the list <br>is running on a Lyris server; this is a very new (and VERY NICE!) server, <br>so be aware that the commands might be 
different from those that you are <br>used to using on other list servers. (For more information on Lyris, see <br>&lt;http://www.lyris.com/&gt;.) <br> <br>1. First of 
all, almost everything that you might need to do on the <br>server is most easily and effectively performed via Lyris's Web interface <br>at &lt;http://clio.lyris.net/rhapsody/&gt;. 
<br> <br>2. In case you do not have Web access, here are some key commands; in all <br>cases, the default server address is: &lt;lyris@clio.lyris.net&gt;. Other 
<br>addresses are shown where appropriate. Note that commands may be placed <br>in either the subject line or in the body of the message: <br> <br>SUBSCRIBING:

&lt;http://clio.lyris.net/rhapsody/&gt; and click the link in the "Change <br>Your Settings" section. You'll need to enter your e-mail address and <br>password (if you chose one) to 
continue. <br> <br>(If you've forgotten your password, you can type in your e-mail address <br>in the field at the bottom of the page and click "Get password" to 
<br>request Lyris to e-mail your password to you.) <br> <br>At the following page, you can read messages, post a message, adjust <br>your settings, or unsubscribe. 
From the settings page, you can change <br>your status (MAIL, DIGEST, INDEX, or NOMAIL), choose whether or not to <br>see your own messages, and choose whether or not you want to 
receive a <br>separate acknowledgement via e-mail when one of your messages is posted <br>to the list, You can also change your e-mail address if you need to. <br>When you

<br>URL: &lt;http://clio.lyris.net/cgi-bin/lyris.pl?visit=rhapsody&gt; <br> <br>5. RDL WEB SITE: The Rhapsody Discussion List has a web site at 
<br>&lt;http://user.icx.net/~bgiles/rhapsody/&gt;. The web site includes all the <br>information in this document, PLUS a list of common questions and <br>answers, and a list of 
Rhapsody resources, both on and off the Internet. <br>Please visit the site and let us know what you want to see there. <br> <br>6. OBTAINING THE FAQ AND OTHER DOCUMENTS: 
You can receive the current <br>version of the Rhapsody Discussion List FAQ by e-mail at any time by <br>sending an e-mail message to &lt;rdl-faq@clio.lyris.net&gt;. The subject line 
<br>and body text of your message are ignored. Simply sending a blank <br>message to this address is sufficient. <br> <br>You can receive a current list of 
Rhapsody resources by sending a blank <br>e-mail message to &lt;rhapsody-resources@clio.lyris.net&gt;. <br> <br>You can receive a current list of Rhapsody questions and answers 
by <br>sending a blank e-mail message to &lt;rhapsody-faq@clio.lyris.net&gt;. <br> <br>7. BOUNCED MAIL: One of the key features of Lyris is its ability to handle 
<br>mail bounces transparently to the list owner; as such, bounced mail will <br>be handled primarily by the Lyris list server. <br> <br>8. POSTS/REPLIES FROM 
DIGEST USERS: You *must* change the Subject: line <br>when replying to a digest; all posts with "RHAPSODY DIGEST" in the <br>Subject: line will be rejected by the server (you will 
receive a <br>"rejection letter" when this happens). <br> <br>PROBLEMS: If you have ANY problems related to the Rhapsody Discussion <br>List, *please* do not post 
them to the list. Listmoms (list managers) <br>are at your disposal for this very purpose; please avail yourself of <br>the resource: <br> <br>  Bruce Giles

listmoms at once, <br>  use the address &lt;rhapsody-owner@clio.lyris.net&gt;. <br> <br>If you have any questions about the list or the Lyris server, feel free <br>to
