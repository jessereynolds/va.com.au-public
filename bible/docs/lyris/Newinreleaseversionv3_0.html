</B><p>
  <br><B><I>Site admin can disable a mailing list</I></B>: the site administrator now has the ability to disable a mailing list.  This is very helpful for sites doing list hosting, who 
want to disable a mailing list due to lack of payment. You must edit the mailing list through the site admin menu in order to have access to this feature. See  <a href="Disable.html">Disable</a>. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Site admin can limit the number of members on a list</I></B>: the site administrator can limit the number of members that are allowed on a mailing list. This is useful for sites doing list 
hosting, where the cost being charges is based on a maximum number of members.  You must edit the mailing list through the site admin menu in order to have access to this feature. See  
<a href="MaximumMembers.html">Maximum Members</a>. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Progress reports can also now report full SMTP delivery summary</I></B>: the "progress reports" feature in the List Info page can now full delivery progress information for every member 
which was attempted in a mailing.  This way, if you are having some sort of delivery problem, you can enable these reports, and you will immediately receive a message which details the reason why 
each message attempt was unsuccessful. This can be very helpful in finding the cause of problems.  See  <a href="DeliveryReports.html">Delivery Reports</a>. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Ability to have parent/child lists</I></B>: one mailing list can now be a member of another mailing list. For example, you might want to have a "sports-announcements" parent list, and two 
child lists, such as "soccer-announcements" and "tennis-announcements". See  <a href="ChildList.html">Child List</a>.<B><I> 
</I></B><p>
<b><i>Mail merge codes for list and sites now enabled in most documents</I></B>: you can now use the Site and List mail merge codes in most documents, include Hello and Goodbye documents.  This makes it easy to 
create a template "Hello" document that can be reused in many lists, and which automatically adapts to the use in question. See  <a href="Hello.html">Hello</a>. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Option added to allow messages with blank subjects</I></B>: you can now choose to allow messages to be posted which have a blank subject. Previously, Lyris would not allow them. Related to 
this, some email programs place a carriage return in the Subject, which is highly non-standard and caused Lyris to sometimes think the subject was blank. Lyris now removes the carriage return in the 
Subject line, to make the message conform better with standards. See <a href="AllowBlankSubject.html">Allow Blank Subject</a> 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Admin is notified when a mail loop is detected</I></B><B>:</B> Lyris now sends a note to the server admin when a mail loop has been detected and automatically halted, using the new loop 
detection threshold feature.  See  <a href="AdminEmailAddress.html">Admin Email Address</a>. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>New pw= option when subscribing</I></B>: when subscribing by sending to lyris@servername or listname-request@servername, you can now specify the password you want to use for your membership 
on the subscribe line.  Simply add the "pw=XYZ" command to your subscribe request, substituting your password for "XYZ".  For example: "subscribe jazztalk pw=sesame". See  <a href="SetyourPassword.html">Set your Password</a> 
. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Added Server Cookie commands to Perl toolkit</I></B>: several new commands, dealing with cookies, were added to the Perl/Lyris toolkit.  These all server-side cookies to be set and 
maintained across distinct LCP sessions. The new commands are: CookiePut(key, value); $value = CookieGet(key); CookieClear(value or "*"). See the Programmer's Guide at www.lyris.com/guide for more 
information. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Added Thread-priority commands to Perl toolkit</I></B>: a SetPriority(level) command was added to the Perl/Lyris toolkit.  This controls the thread priority of the commands run on the Lyris 
server, as requested by the controlling Perl program.  This feature is especially useful if you are writing long-running Perl programs, and do not want them to interfere with the operation of 
more-important tasks. The priorities settings are: 1: lowest, 2: below normal, 3: normal, 4: above normal, 5: highest. See the Programmer's Guide at www.lyris.com/guide for more information. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Security vulnerability fix</I></B>: a potential security vulnerability was found in the Lyris web interface and fixed.  All versions after v3.0b1 have this fix. </I></B><p>
<B><I>Option to disable Message-Id rewriting</I></B><B>:</B> Added option to leave the Message-id header alone, and instead use X-Lyris-Message-Id for that purpose. Some users object to Lyris 
rewriting the Message-Id to be unique for each member, so this allows them to disable this feature. This option is the in the list settings.  The Message-Id syntax was also rewritten to put the 
recipient email address in it, for easier human reading of bounces.  See  <a href="RewriteMessage_IdHeader.html">Rewrite Message-Id Header</a>. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Speed improvements</I></B><B>: </B>Dramatic speed improvement for mail sending on Lyris Platinum Plus for Windows and Unix. A typical machine can easily achieve 60,000 messages/hour with 
a plain Pentium 200 on a T1. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Improvements to the transaction logging</I></B>: now logs the weeding out of crossposted members, logs mail jobs interrupted by a shutdown, and other events.  </I></B><p>
<B><I>List settings now have a comment field</I></B><B>:</B> Added a "comment" field to the list settings, which end-users can use to put whatever information you like.  </I></B><p>
<B><I>Improved loop detection</I></B>: if the MAIL FROM of an incoming message is blank, then the message is always  understood as error mail. This is conformance with the RFC standards.</I></B><p>
<B><I>Ctrl-Break toggles debugging info</I></B>: Added the ability to turn debug mode on/off w/o turning off the server with ctrl-break, when running Lyris as a foreground application on Windows. 
 On Unix, sending "kill -usr1 `cat /etc/lyris.pid`" will do this as well. You must be running Lyris in the foreground to see the debug messages.  See  <a href="StartingLyris.html">Starting Lyris</a>. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Option to disable [email] address rewriting</I></B>: Added the option to disable [email] address rewriting, as a server config level setting. See  <a href="RewritePurge_IdTag.html">Rewrite Purge-Id Tag</a> 
. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>Received: line now Internet standards compliant</I></B>: The Received: header line now conforms to Internet standards. Previously, the Time Zone identifier and the "with" string were not 
standards compliant. 
</I></B><p>
<B><I>SMTP Thread-tracking option</I></B>: when you start Lyris in the foreground with the "threadtrack" option on the command line, Lyris will keep track of the current state of every SMTP mail 
thread.  You can view the instant status of all mail sending threads from the server statistics page, where this additional information is appended.  See  <a href="StartingLyris.html">Starting Lyris</a>.
