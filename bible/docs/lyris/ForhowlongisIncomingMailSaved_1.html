<h2>     For how long is Incoming Mail Saved?<p>
</h2>Lyris keeps all the mail it has received and sent and saves it in its database. The mail is not removed until the server administrator shuts the Lyris server down and runs "lyris 
dbpack", "lyris dbfastpack" or upgrade the version of Lyris that runs the packing process as part of the upgrade.  
<p>
For this reason, on a very busy Lyris server it is wise to have a fair amount of free disk space, and to pack your databases every once in a while.  How often you pack also depends on how much email 
you want to be able to look at from the <I>Incoming Mail </I>and <I>Outgoing Mail </I>web interface pages.
