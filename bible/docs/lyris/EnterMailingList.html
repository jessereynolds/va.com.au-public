<h3>Enter Mailing List</h3>
After clicking on a mailing list from the Topic screen, the user must enter the mailing list to proceed further.  This means that they can join the mailing list, visit the mailing list, 
get information about it, or if they are already a member, log in to the mailing list. 
<p>
If the user is already a member of this mailing list, they can enter either their name or their email address.  If the user has selected a password, they will need to enter that here as well.  Users 
who subscribe using email are automatically assigned a blank password.  The name they are assigned is extracted from their email address.  For example, if their email address said: 
<I>bob@acme.com</I> (Bob Smith), Lyris would have extracted the name <I>Bob Smith</I> and saved their subscription using that name.  The name and password are not case sensitive. 
</I><p>
If the mailing list is not set to closed membership (where the administrator has chosen to add members by hand), then the <I>Join </I>button is displayed.  Pressing the <I>Join </I>button will 
bring the user to the Join page. 
</I><p>
If the mailing list is set to allow non-members to see general information about the mailing list, then the <I>Get Info </I>button is displayed.  After the user has viewed the general information 
about the mailing list, they will be brought back to this screen.  The Get Info button is useful for users who want to learn a little bit about a mailing list before becoming a member. 
</I><p>
If the mailing list is set to allow visitors, then the <I>Visit Without Joining</I> button is displayed.  Allowing Visitors means that people who are not members of the mailing list can read and 
search the messages of that mailing list.  They cannot contribute to the mailing list, and cannot receive mailing list contributions as email.  The only commands that are available to them, are on 
the Lyris Web Interface, and these are <I>Read Messages</I> and <I>Search Messages</I>.  If the user presses the <I>Visit Without Joining </I>button, they will go directly to a Menu of choices 
that looks just like the Menu of Member Choices, except with fewer choices available. 
</I><p>
The <I>Enter Mailing List </I>page has the following elements:</I><p>
<B>Mailing List Graphic <br></B>The mailing list graphic is displayed at the top.  If there is no graphic defined for this list, the text name of the list is displayed instead.</B><p>
<B>Page Title <br></B>The words "Enter mailing list: YYY" are displayed as the title of this page.</B><p>
<B>Member Login <br></B>If the user is already a member of this mailing list, they can enter their name or their email address, and their password (if they have defined one).  After doing 
this, the Lyris Server will check their identity, and they will be presented with the Menu of Member Choices.  If they are not listed as a member, or their password was incorrect, they will not be 
able to proceed.  
</B><p>
Note: if you enter an administrator identity here, you will be allowed to enter the mailing list as a visitor.  However, being a site or a server administrator does not automatically make you a 
member of every mailing list.  If you want to be a member of a mailing list, you must join it, just as everyone else does. 
<p>
<B>Join button</B> <br>This button is displayed if the mailing list is not a closed mailing list (where the administrator has chosen to add members by hand).  Clicking it brings the user 
to the Join Mailing List page.  See <a href="JoinMailingList.html">Join Mailing List</a> 
</B><p>
<B>Get Information button <br></B>This button is displayed if the mailing list allows non-members to view general information about the mailing list.  Clicking this button brings the user 
to an informational page, after which they can return to the Enter Mailing List page. 
</B><p>
<B>Visit Mailing List Without Joining <br></B>This button is displayed if the mailing list is set up to allow visitors.  Clicking this button will bring you to the Menu of Member Choices, 
except that you will only be allowed to Read messages, Search messages, and view general information about the mailing list.  You will not be allowed to contribute to the mailing list.  
</B><p>
You can point users directly to the Visit Mailing List page by means of a special URL.  When you use your browser to go to the visit a list page, you can bookmark the URL that is displayed, and this 
URL will bring users directly to this page.  
<p>
Or, if you prefer, you can build the URL yourself.  A sample URL might be:<p>
<font face='Courier New'><ul>http://clio.lyris.net/cgi-bin/lyris.pl?visit=bach<p>
</ul></font>* the first part of the URL, <I>http://clio.lyris.net/cgi-bin/lyris.pl</I>, is the general URL to the Lyris web interface for your site. <br>* append 
<I>?visit=&lt;listname&gt;</I> for your mailing list 
</I><p>
<B>Did you forget your password?</B><p>
<b></B>If you forgot your password and you are a member of this mailing list, Lyris can email your password to you.  If this is the case, enter your email address in the space provided, and click the "get 
password" button. Lyris will verify that the email address you provided corresponds to a member of this mailing list.  If it does, the password for the email address will be immediately emailed to 
that address.  If the email address does not correspond to a member of that mailing list, you might want to try another email address, because you might have been subscribed under a different 
address.
