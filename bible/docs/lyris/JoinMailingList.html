<h3>Join Mailing List</h3>
If a user clicks the <I>Join</I> button, they will be presented with a page asking for information from them.</I><p>
If the mailing list is set up as <I>Open</I> membership (no approval required), the user will be able to proceed directly to the Menu of Member Choices after completing this page.  </I><p>
If the mailing list is set to <I>Password</I> membership, there will be a space for the user to enter the membership password. If the user does not know the membership password, they will not be 
allowed to join.  If they do know the membership password, they will be able to proceed directly to the Menu of Member Choices after completing this page.  
</I><p>
If the mailing list is set to <I>Private </I>membership, the user will be able to fill in the Join page, but will not be able to proceed until their membership is approved by a list administrator.  </I><p>
If the mailing list is set to <I>Closed</I> membership, the user will not be able to even go to the Join page, as it will not have been an available choice from the Enter Mailing List page.  A 
<I>Closed</I> mailing list means that the mailing list administrator has chosen to add members themselves, and does not allow people to ask to join. 
</I><p>
Note: all user information can be changed later on, by choosing the <I>Your Settings </I>button from the Menu of Member Choices.</I><p>
To join a mailing list using email, use the <I>subscribe</I> command.  To change your member settings by email once you have joined, use the <I>set</I> command.  To determine your membership 
settings using email, use the <I>query </I>command. 
</I><p>
The Join Mailing List page has the following elements:<p>
<B>Full Name <br></B>(required) The user must enter their full name here.</B><p>
<B>Email Address <br></B>(required) The user must enter their email address here.</B><p>
<B>Password <br></B>(optional) If the user desires to have a password, to protect themselves from people claiming to be them, they may enter one here.  The password will be required in the 
future in order for the user to continue past the Enter Mailing List page. 
</B><p>
<B>Re-type Password <br></B>(optional) In order to confirm that the password was correctly entered, the user must re-enter their password here.  If the contents of (3) and (4) are not 
exactly the same, the system will let the user know this fact, and ask them to re-enter their password. 
</B><p>
<B>Member type <br></B>(required) This choice defines how the user wants to receive messages from the mailing list.  The choices are:</B><p>
* <I>receive mail as it is contributed</I> - as soon as someone contributes a message to the mailing list, the user will receive a copy of that message.  This option is commonly known by other 
programs as "mail". 
</I><p>
* <I>periodic digest</I> - each night, around 1 in the morning, the user will receive a single email message containing all the messages contributed to the mailing list that day.  At the top of the 
message will be a numbered list of the subjects in that digest, followed by the complete messages themselves.  This option is commonly known by other programs as "digest". 
</I><p>
* <I>periodic index of subject</I> - each night, around 1 in the morning, the user will receive a single email message containing all the subject lines of all the messages contributed to the 
mailing list that day.  If any of the messages interest the user, the bottom of the index gives the email command that will retrieve the bodies of the messages. 
</I><p>
* <I>receive no mail</I> - no email is sent to the user.  The user is free to go the Lyris Web Interface whenever they want, and read the full text of the messages there.  This setting is also 
useful for people who want the ability to contribute to a mailing list, but do not care to see the contributions to the mailing list.  This option is commonly known by other programs as "nomail". 
</I><p>
<B>Acknowledgment <br></B>(required) When a user contributes a message to the mailing list, they have the option of being notified that the message was in fact delivered and sent out.  If 
a user is sending out an important announcement, they might want to be notified that it really went out. 
</B><p>
<B>See Your Messages <br></B>(required) Determines whether you will receive a copy of your own messages when you contribute them to the mailing list.  By default, this is set to yes, so 
that when you post a message to this mailing list, you will receive a copy of the posting, just as others on the list do. 
</B><p>
<B>Save button <br></B>Once the user is finished entering the above information, they must click the Save button.  As stated at the beginning of this section, if the list is <I>Open</I> 
or <I>Password</I> protected, they will be allowed to go directly to the Menu of Member Choices.  If the list is <I>Private</I>, they will have to wait for the list administrator to approve their 
membership.
