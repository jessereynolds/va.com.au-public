<!-- Because Soupermail's usually called from the /cgi-bin/
     directory, relative HTML links can go awry. So, to counter
     this, here's a BASE element, which uses the URL of the
     very first form to make sure all relative links are sane. -->

<h1>Soupermail Multipart Form - 3</h1>

<p>This page is the <b>third</b> part of a three part form. </p>

<form method="post" action="/cgi-bin/soupermail.pl">

<!-- Here's something cunning. Because we want to keep the
     configuration paths relative, I'm using the path from the
     last form's configuration file to specify where to
     find this form's configuration file. It makes sense if you
     think about it... honest :) -->
<input type="hidden" name="SoupermailConf" value="<output
name="http_config_path">multi3.con">

<!-- Now we want to include the values from the second form. Note that they're
     of type="escaped", because we don't want any of the stuff to mess up our
     nice HTML -->
<input type="hidden" name="soupermail_comments" value="<output
name="soupermail_comments" type="escaped">">

<!-- Here we're including values from the first form. They don't have to be
     escaped, because that was all handled by the previous form. -->
<input type="hidden" name="your_name" value="<output name="your_name">">
<input type="hidden" name="comments" value="<output name="comments">">

<!-- Here we keep the original form's URL so we can set later BASE elements
     correctly. -->
<input type="hidden" name="original_referer" value="<output name="original_referer">">

<!-- Here we put the name that we got from the very first part back in.
     Notice the type of the output tag is "unescapedhtml". Firstly, its
     unescaped because it was encoded to get past the middle form, and
     secondly its html because there may angle brackets in there.     -->
<p>Thanks <b><output name="your_name" type="unescapedhtml"></b> for filling 
in the following fields:</p>

<ul>

<p>The Soupermail configuration file that made this page looks like this:</p>
<table width="90%" border="1">
<tr>
<td class="egcon">
<pre class="egcon">
<!--#include virtual="multi2.con"-->
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This page has been built from a Soupermail template called 
<code><a href="multi3.txt">multi3.txt</a></code>.
Look at the template with a text editor, and you'll see some interesting
use of &lt;output&gt; elements. Compare the template with the source
of this page and see how the output tags have been translated.</p>
