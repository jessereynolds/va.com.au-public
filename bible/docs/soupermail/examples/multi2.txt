<!-- Because Soupermail's usually called from the /cgi-bin/
     directory, relative HTML links can go awry. So, to counter
     this, here's a BASE element, which uses the URL of the
     very first form to make sure all relative links are sane. -->

<p>This page is part <b>two</b> of a three part form. </p>

<form method="post" action="/cgi-bin/soupermail.pl">

<!-- Here's something cunning. Because we want to keep the
     configuration paths relative, I'm using the path from the
     last form's configuration file to specify where to
     find this form's configuration file. It makes sense if you
     think about it... honest :) -->
<input type="hidden" name="SoupermailConf" value="<output
name="http_config_path">multi2.con">

<!-- Now we want to include the values from the first form. Note that they're
     of type="escaped", because we don't want any of the stuff to mess up our
     nice HTML -->
