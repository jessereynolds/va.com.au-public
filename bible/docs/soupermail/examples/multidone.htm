<h1>Soupermail MultiPart Form Finished</h1>

<p>OK, your multipart form has been sent off to the email
address you specified. Have a good gander through all the
templates used in these examples to get a good idea what was
going on. Look at <a href="multimail.txt">the email template</a>
to see how the type="unescaped" option is used to return
encoded form fields back into human readable form.</p>

<p>Return <a href="index.htm">to the examples page</a>.</p>
