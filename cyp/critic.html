// WAXON/OFF BUTT SET
// this set of scripts implements automatic buttons for Netscape3+
// and MSIE 4+.  buttons must follow the following guidelines
//
// see also: http://www.va.com.au/afringe for a version of his script which
//           implements a click butt in addition to mouse overs.
//
// naming:   all buttons need an 'on' and 'off' state, reflecting
//           whether the mouse is on or off the button.
//           the on and off states must be the same filetype (ie gif or jpg)
//           different buttons may be different fle types however.
//
// use:      name your images and call onLoad="prewax();return true;" from
//           within the body tag. see the example button below.

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H2><I>Nuestro propio animal</I>...</H2>
  <P><B>It translates as 'an animal of our own', my Chilean friend Pedro
  tells me. What a line. The dichotomies of wildness and control, ownership
  and alienation, are brought into sharp relief in just five words, or three
  if you don't speak English properly.</B></P>
  <P>It's no small irony, then, that I could hear these words being spat
  out whenever I stumbled into a dark, beer-soaked den where <B>Cerveza y
  Putas</B> was trashing our musical landscape. <B>Anarchists without a cause,
  satirists without a joke, angry without a purpose, Cerveza y Putas were
  just what we didn't need at a time we didn't need it,</B> which is how
  they became the most important post(modern)-punk band in Australia. They're
  animals, no question, but can they ever truly be our own? No. Cerveza y
  Putas are ultimately too distant, too perverse, too <I>other </I>to ever
  be contained within its audience's expectations.</P>
  <P>Perhaps it all started (as all these things do) with an undergraduate
  prank. Put a Spanish-speaking non-singer, a classically trained guitarist,
  a jazz drummer and a drug dealer holding a bass guitar onto stage, and
  watch it all implode. Musically, it was a farce. But those lucky enough
  to witness those formative gigs found that Cerveza y Putas (named by a
  friend of the band in memoriam to his parents who had died in a sidecar
  accident in 1976) had the chutzpah, the charisma, the sheer <I>spunk</I>,
  to tap into the stream of consciousness that has fuelled music based on
  sheer hate, from Woody Guthrie through the Stooges and early Split Enz,
  right to the present day.</P>
  <P>Without wanting to overplay my own role in Cerveza's development, I
  was there from the first days. Like Jon Landau stumbling across <B>Bruce
  Springsteen</B> in 1974, I knew that I was witnessing history. I couldn't
  back away from it even if I wanted to. I'll never forget the words spoken
  to me by bassist Dave Krantz at one of the band's embryonic gigs, while
  watching another band on the bill:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>&quot;That bass player - y'know, he's a really good bass player.
    He can play really complex riffs without even looking at his bass. But
    if you look at him you can tell that he's a total tosser. And the band's
    really boring.&quot;</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Lives can spin around on a twenty-cent piece like a Volvo with a tight
  turning circle. Sometimes it takes no more than one conversation. At this
  moment, I felt that my fate, and the fate of contemporary pub rock, were
  both spinning on the same proverbial item of trivial currency.</P>
  <P>On stage, Cerveza were a pastiche of a pastiche. They taught us to forget
  everything we ever knew, but to act like we'd remembered it wrongly. Most
  bands welcome even the most inappropriate cover of their songs - mediocrity
  needs exposure - and yet I have witnessed innumerable songwriters break
  down and cry upon discovering that Cerveza is rehearsing a tune that they
  penned. Cerveza y Putas undermined everything that was good and noble in
  what they played&shy; they brought out the Satan in the most angelic child.
  They weren't out to trash rock'n'roll by conquering the charts. Too smart
  and too cynical for that self-defeating game, they were out to destroy
  the bands that were conquering the charts. Their success in achieving this
  nihilist goal, within the limited period they were an effective band, chills
  me to this day. <B>Cerveza y Putas</B> were instrumental in the demise
  of <B>Ratcat</B>, <B>The Hummingbirds</B>, <B>Lemonheads</B>, <B>Pixies</B>,
  <B>The Replacements</B> and <B>H&uuml;sker D&uuml;</B>, but there can be
  little doubt that the list of casualties does not stop there. Just how
  much damage they really did we may never know.</P>
  <P>In the earliest days of the band, those who witnessed a Cerveza show
  frequently staggered from the room shocked and appalled, and even nausea
  was a common reaction. (Guitarist Paul Champion later admitted to me, &quot;I'd
  be sick at those first Cerveza shows all the time. It was pretty rugged.&quot;).
  And yet the crowds kept coming back for more. The reason was David Penberthy.
  Penberthy, tagged as the band's 'Swarthy Immigrant Singing Sensation' by
  an early record company press release, combined Wildean <I>bon mot</I>s
  with ESL non-sequiturs in a manner not seen since Joao Gilberto set himself
  on fire while trying to light his own flatulence onstage in Budapest in
  1968. Back in 1992, seas of fans gazed adoringly at Penberthy's ample frame,
  feeling the addictive thrall of knowing that the man on stage could effortlessly
  glance into the depths of your soul, and wouldn't hesitate to make a mystifying
  comment about what he'd seen.</P>
  <P>Within months of Cerveza's debut, Penberthy had developed a cult of
  personality that threatened to tear the band apart. By June 1992, Penberthy
  was flooded with increasingly lucrative offers to launch a solo career.
  Smart enough to realise that going solo would have secured his financial
  future at the expense of his credibility and the privacy of his family,
  Penberthy came up with a typically left-of-centre plan to save the band.
  He would stay with Cerveza only if it started writing its own songs. The
  group that had made itself infamous by taking other people's artworks and
  metaphorically defecating over them onstage, would now start creating its
  own.</P>
  <P><B>It was a typically Penberthy-esque masterstroke that ensured another
  few months of headlines for a band that was already Australia's most notorious
  (perhaps second only to the reformed Skyhooks).</B></P>
  <P>Even when Cerveza became musically predictable (estimates vary between
  the second and the third song they wrote as a band), Penberthy's <B>Man-Size
  charisma</B> and scattergun wit ensured that they remained the most exciting
  live prospect in the southern hemisphere. Their domination of the poorest
  half of the world was confirmed during their wildly successful but controversy-studded
  tour of <B>Nicaragua</B>, <B>Panama</B>, <B>Cuba</B> and <B>Venezuela</B>
  in 1994. Once relevant officials had been bribed and charges dropped, Cerveza
  returned to the country more famous than ever, but perhaps the ructions
  they had endured in the most slimy and corrupt of all continents had robbed
  them of the fiery spirit of chaos that had fuelled their best work.</P>
  <P>Dave Krantz's drug problems had become increasingly pronounced, Paul
  Champion was working on a rock opera that left an ever-diminishing amount
  of time for the band, and drummer Ben Allen had not adjusted well to fame,
  using the notoriety of his name to run up at most bars in town limitless
  tabs that (due to some poor investment decisions) he had little hope of
  paying off.</P>
  <P>They knew that if it was better to burn out than fade away, they'd have
  to go one better and blow up. They did so in 1995, playing a series of
  profoundly drunken but incendiary shows that would forever cement their
  reputation as Australia's greatest Spanish-language punk band. In the dying
  seconds of one of their dying shows, Penberthy is heard to shout joyously,
  <I>apropos </I>of nothing, &quot;Up and down like a joggers' nipple.&quot;
  And so they had been. After a few short years together, Cerveza y Putas
  had indeed collapsed as everyone had expected them to do; but not before
  changing the course of contemporary music.</P>
  <P>It wasn't surprising, given the superhuman force of the four personalities
  in the band, that there was seemingly little love lost once it was all
  over. The four members soon moved to three different states, and media
  reports gleefully announced that no band member would acknowledge any other
  when passing in the street.</P>
  <P>Of course, for those on the inside (like myself), such reports were
  not only exaggerated, but actively engineered by the band in a Machiavellian
  stratagem to continue their notoriety even after death.</P>
  <P>The chemistry was too strong to break forever, but how could Cerveza,
  which had formed its career on trashing clich&eacute;s, get back together
  without falling into the hoariest clich&eacute; of them all&shy; the Hits'n'Memories
  Reunion Tour? The answer, once again, lay in Penberthy's perverse mind.
  The band would play a single gig at a semi-disused digger pub next to a
  soul-crushing concrete shopping mall in a far-flung outer suburb of Canberra.
  The venue would have a maximum capacity of 120. No prior rehearsal would
  be allowed.</P>
  <P>And so it shall be. The sheer contempt they have shown for the legions
  of fans who have waited patiently for their reformation, in this single
  gesture, both underlines their importance as a band and will further enshrine
  their place in musical history. For those who chart the social and artistic
  ebb and flow of our fragile culture, I would as soon miss it as I would
  be the A&amp;R rep who dismissed <I>The </I>Velvet Underground &amp; Nico
  as 'a bunch of tuneless droning- and what's with the stupid banana on the
  cover?'</P>
  <P>To return to the original conundrum, <B>Cerveza y Putas</B> will <I>not</I>
  be our animals; but we can count ourselves lucky to be born at a time when
  we could witness their rutting.</P>
