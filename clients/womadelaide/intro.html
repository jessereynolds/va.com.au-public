<H2>The global music event of the<br>International Year for Tolerance</H2>
</center>
<p>The International Year for Tolerance provides an opportunity to discuss what makes Australia a tolerant nation, and to listen to and learn from each other's experiences. Tolerance also is a particularly appropriate theme for the first year of the International Decade for the World's Indigenous People - furthering our achievements of reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and other Australians.
<p>By supporting the objectives of the International Year for Tolerance, my Government is demonstrating its commitment to justice, inclusion, acknowledging rights and responsibilities, and respect for difference and diversity.
<p>The objectives of the WOMADELAIDE Festival, gathering such richly talented artists, musicians and performers from all over the world, will further the aims of the International Year for Tolerance, and I wish WOMAD every success.
