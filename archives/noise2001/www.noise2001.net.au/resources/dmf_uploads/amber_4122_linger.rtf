A possum\par dinned across the corrugated roof. I wanted\par to break down in the simplicity of black,\par that complete and absolute absence.\par \par The next morning, I drove to where Cuttagee \par meets the Pacific and threw a dilapidated \par tennis ball around with my brother, waiting \par for the poddy mullet to glide into the bait traps \par we had set. I did not once think of you or your routine,\par as rays of salt water went spinning from the ball \par and silver darts caught themselves for a piece \par of bread in the plastic tubes of the traps. \par \par When I came home, though, Mum told me \par you had called. I snapped right back then \par for you had kissed me, a moonlike\par kiss that sent the tides off kilter\par and for which I was not there, having\par arrived in time to catch its aftermath,\par the trace of your lips in the air, a moist \par signature, fluttering in South Coast breeze.}{\par }}
