&quot;Repercussions of a redirected life.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
<B>BROKEN OR CHOSEN?</B><BR>
<BR>
I watch his mouth as he tries to speak - my uncle. My uncle is 40 today - middle-aged, full of wisdom according to convention. His writing, however, should belong to a four year old; his walk to a newly born calf and his mind... I often wonder about his mind. Is a mind synonymous with a brain? Is one the literary romanticism and the other the scientific explanation, like desire and hormone? A brain contains blood and nerves and cerebral tissue. It's just an organ. It's like a muscle. It's like a computer. That's how my godmother sees it, she has never considered the mind. She says that emotion and memory are governed by the heart, but that they dwell in the soul. I used to ask her where the soul was, but she never answered. She would only look at me, impatience and encouragement fused on her face. I think this is how I am staring at my uncle now as I wait for the words to exit his mouth. It's a challenging process for him. Before the syllables reach my ears, they have been fought by his lips and battered by his tongue. They have been churned by his breath and pumped by his lungs. Did they start in his brain? Were they damaged before creation or did they appear, perfect and untainted, in his soul and become tarnished during the journey to my ears?<BR>
My uncle's sentence is complete. It has been minutes. I think back to the beginning and piece together his meaning: &quot;I listened to rock 'n' roll when I was your age&quot;. I smile. I know he is confused. His accident happened when he was 14. Does he forget my age or his? Do years now blend together for him? I think that I would let that happen if I were him. His memory was useful before that day. It had inspiring accomplishments and promising changes to document and treasure. After that day, there was only pain and regret and impossibility. If I were him, I would have fired my memory, perhaps figuratively, perhaps literally. It would have been happier, enjoying its retirement or resting as ashes. Now it has only monotonous additions to deal with: having a swimming lesson, using a wheelchair; being enticed to exercise, seeing a specialist. The doctor said that my uncle's short-term memory is weak, &quot;It was damaged immeasurably&quot;, but that his long-term memory is intact, &quot;as far as we can deduce&quot;. <BR>
I am fascinated by my uncle's life, by his predicament, by his disability. I imagine myself as his memory. I take on the alias and I trespass into its files. I am searching for the envelope holding that day, at 14. <BR>
Michael presses the towel to his eyes, wiping the soap-suds clear. He sings to Rick Hooper's words as he pushes the shower curtain aside and braves the glare of the bathroom's naked bulb.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He's the meanest racer you'll ever glimpse.<BR>
 As his engine growls, his eyes lock fierce.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Hooper's voice resonates from the transistor radio that Michael has set up on the cabinet's shelf. Michael loves the power in the music. The beat pushes him onwards and the words speak to him. He dries his body to the rhythm, oblivious to Stephen's calls through the keyhole. He reaches for the radio's button and flicks it to off at the precise moment the song fades to silence. He unlocks the bathroom door and mimes the guitar solo, as he struts out into the hall. &quot;What're ya doin', Mick?&quot; Stephen asks, his question baited with impatient awe. &quot;I'm a rebel rock star, don't have to answer to you,&quot; Michael replies with a smirk. He thrashes his air guitar. Stephen grins. Michael ups the volume of his vocal guitar solo.<BR>
Stephen is 12, two years younger than Michael's 14. Stephen idolises his brother. He studies Michael's every move. From the skill with which he bowls to the detail he employs in his pictures of dragons, Michael is perfect to his little disciple. Stephen still remembers with reverence, the time that Michael was called to Brother Hawthorne's office in sixth class and received double lashings of the strap for telling the Brother that he hit like an old woman. The older boys respected Stephen at school. He was Michael's kid brother. <BR>
Michael tackles his little brother. The air is shattered by Stephen's squeals of delight. Michael holds him in a headlock and ruffles his hair. &quot;Try an' get outta this one, Stevie.&quot; <BR>
&quot;Michael, did you get firewood?&quot; Mum comes upon them. She means to scold, but her tone is soft. &quot;Michael, you were supposed to ride down to the lumber yard yesterday.&quot; Michael tenses his fist and opens his pouted mouth to speak, but he is silenced by his mother's eyes. She flashes him a look that is laced with a mother's power. Michael resigns his fist and turns towards the door.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He's on fire, the crowds aware.<BR>
He's on fire, their dare-devil hero.<BR>
He's on fire, his headlights glare.<BR>
He's on fire, he'll never do zero.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Michael hums. The lyrics swim through his mind. The wind beats down on him and he peddles hard. The clouds are fat with rain. The lumber is packed tightly in the basket on the front of his bike. He is normally electric, but the wood is slowing him down. He hopes he doesn't get caught in the storm. The song charges him.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He's always laps ahead of the pack.<BR>
No-one thinks he'll ever crack.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Michael's feet pound the peddles. Drops of rain begin to christen him. He tightens his grip on the handlebars and tucks his head down. He speeds with determination. Not far now, he thinks. He is racing down Rathmore Street, past fences, past mail boxes and welcome mats. He is not looking now. He accelerates. He crosses the driveway of number 29 without so much as a glance in any direction. Suddenly there is light all around him.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Headlights glare.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It is the sound that reaches him first. A frenzied hand hammering a horn. A screeching of tyres on the slippery road. A tearing of brake cables. A splintering of bicycle iron. Wood flies everywhere. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;On fire.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He feels wind spiral around his body. He hears his limbs batter against the car as he flies over it. He hears a tumbling and shattering, like marbles being dropped on a tiled floor. He lands on the other side of the car, metres from the driveway, in the middle of the road. He lands on his head.<BR>
I offer my uncle a piece of his birthday cake. He looks at it like a challenge. He fumbles with his fork, scrabbling to cut a morsel. It is a difficult task that he has not mastered yet. I smile. I am uncomfortable now. &quot;Would you like me to cut it for you?&quot; I try to say this gently. I don't want to be presumptuous. I am his niece. I am the one who is supposed to be spoiled or patronised. I wonder whether his mind gets frustrated with his body. Do its connections spark with pace and then have to wait, impatient, for his lagging reflexes? Or does his mind dawdle too, in time with his mechanics?<BR>
&quot;Hey, Mick! Do you want to open your present?&quot; Stephen speaks with purposeful clarity. He waits, outside his brother, for a reply. My uncle Stephen is a tall, athletic looking man. There is intelligence in his eyes. I have always imagined that if he smiled on camera, you would see the twinkle of a crystal in his tooth. He crouches next to Michael's chair and clasps his hand. Stephen's strong fingers cocoon Michael's distorted ones. Stephen unwraps the gift for his brother. I know that Michael will radiate enthusiasm whatever the gift is. Will it be because he is genuinely pleased? Or does he feign adoration simply to encourage these sparse visits? He cannot offer much more than his gratitude. The ungrateful or rude members of this home don't have guests anymore. An irritable cousin or a moody sister aren't erased from the Christmas table, but it's easy to forget someone who isn't allowed their own telephone. Sometimes you absent-mindedly forget superfluous details. Sometimes you let things slide out of memory, consciously.<BR>
Stephen slides the wrapping paper off in one fluid motion. Rick Hooper - Magic Race Track, Stephen proclaims. The name means nothing to me. Stephen slides the compact disc into the machine and pushes play. I listen to the dated music begin. It is almost archaic. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The tyres screech and the crowd cheers.<BR>
With a tip of his helmet, he switches gears.<BR>
<BR>
Racing in circles, he'll always be lost in the scene.<BR>
But if you slow it down, you'll hear his scream.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The song finishes. The forgotten singer's voice fades. I watch Michael. He is still. He looks pensive. Stephen puts his arm around the crumpled man's shoulder. Both men are motionless. &quot;Can you remember it?&quot; <BR>
