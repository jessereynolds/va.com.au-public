A story of the statesman touching the citizen in quite a personal manner. <BR>

<BR>
<B>CLEARING OTHERS CRUD</B><BR>
<BR>
I recently started to work in the kitchen at a large city restaurant as a dishwasher. The duty is simple, and I have previous experience, so the task is anything but daunting. All I do for my below-award wage is clear the crud others have made.  Also, as I've noticed my normally stick-thin waistline start to expand as of late, this employment is great, because after seeing plates of food brought to my sink with gnawed and mangled slatherings of sweating seafood, or stained with the blood of an all-too rare rump steak, the last thing I want to do is eat. <BR>
<BR>
This is more of a general rule however, and as the heat increases on a busier night, I need some sustenance to keep me from toppling into the shelving. The chefs are at fever pitch, and I don't yet feel comfortable enough to ask them for any offshoots, so, I turn to the sink. <BR>
<BR>
At times, as already mentioned, you're disgusted by the diner's trails. Other times, it's a case of - 'how bad could it be?'.<BR>
<BR>
Top of my pile is a simple piece of herb bread. The diner has eaten the other two pieces provided, and the remaining piece is unmarked. I look for shining globbletts of saliva, the faintest mark of a tooth. Nothing.  The cheff's back is turned, and I stick the piece in whole, almost inhaling the food. <BR>
<BR>
And there is no effect. Happily, I work towards the end of my shift untouched by any sudden lurgy. <BR>
<BR>
That is, until I venture out of the kitchen to put some coffee cups on the front bar of the restaurant, in view of the diners. <BR>
<BR>
And I'm interested when I see that table 16 is populated by the local parliamentary member, plus some parliamentary advisers, and a few personal assistants. He is large, and laughing whilst spilling wine on his tie. He finishes his glass and calls for staff to bring another bottle. The waitress first groans and then forces a smile as she passes me. She takes the bottle and copes well with the minister tweaking her nipple and screaming like a sugar-fiend 4yr old. She brings back a plate from his table, sure enough with one piece of herb bread on it. She says:-<BR>
<BR>
'what ever you do, don't eat this'<BR>
<BR>
and so I gulp, and stutter the question:-<BR>
<BR>
'can I ask why?'<BR>
<BR>
with which she tells me and then I tell her and she calls for medical assistance and my last memories are cloudy, the waitress dialling for an ambulance, waiting whilst on hold, and screaming at the minister, who is looking at her and laughing again, but now it's a teen horror film laugh. So I fall still holding the coffee cups and they smash and the last words I hear are 'look, minister, you will not be allowed in the restaurant for a month after tonight. It's the third kitchen hand we've lost since you won the election'.<BR>
