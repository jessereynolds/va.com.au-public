<B>ALWAYS WITH YOU</B><BR>
<BR>
Recently I attended a job interview early in the morning for a graduate position in a large company. This went poorly, and so afterwards on my way home I dropped past my local shops in search of a snack and some quiet time to re-evaluate.  I left the jacket for my suit in my car and walked to a cafe, in blue pants with the white shirt-dark tie combo, and stiffened when I saw that all the outside tables at the cafe were taken up by mormons, maybe 25 or 30 of them, bicycles propped against the shopfront, sucking on coffees and pastries. <BR>
<BR>
I attempted to briskly walk past, for I'm aware of this religions skill in honing in on a lost soul and wasting hours of his time with inane dogma, but near the door a large and sweaty member holds out his arm, blocking the entrance, and says:  'brother, where have you been?'<BR>
<BR>
Panic is beginning to build, for all I want is food and some space to think my floundering career through. This elder though, has me mistaken for someone or something else. I say 'sorry mate, I just need to get through'. I spy a waitress though the doorway, it is my goal to reach her and make small talk, but no, this won't happen now, because the blocking hand has moved to my shoulder and sits me down with the others. It leaves a smelly stain on my shirt almost instantly. He says, grinning 'nothing makes me happier than rescuing one of the flock who may have strayed..' to which I ask what the fuck he's on about, and he says 'you may hide in the clothing of the citizen, but underneath you're always with us'. <BR>
<BR>
This is not a pleasant morning. In fact, I am contemplating some form of hideous violence, when the brother pulls out a laptop computer, and dials in a entry. Shortly, a photograph of me comes onto the screen, aged 9, in a school hall doubling as a place of worship. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Some background to the story. My uncle and aunt have searched for an appropriate religion for years to deal with their doubts, and often attended any kind of new ecumenical gathering to check it out. And, when I was younger, sometimes I would go along to a meeting with my cousins, to see what toys I could score if I looked interested enough in the message of the day. <BR>
<BR>
One time, at a strange service with people talking in tongues and falling over on stage, the preacher asked if any of the children would like to hang out afterwards and talk further. I wanted to know why these people made these ridiculous noises. So I waited afterwards. Got a toy, and a happy snap with the preacher. The photo on the laptop is of me at that service.</I><BR>
<BR>
The assembled mormons are nodding their heads and mumbling solemnly. I'm dumbfounded. The waitress I spied earlier brings me a weak coffee and looks me in the eye briefly. This look is the last glimpse of freedom I'll have for a while, and after finishing I speechlessly get doubled on elder Darren's bike, on the way to the local ministry to pick up some extra pamphlets for me to check out.<BR>
