&quot;Do you always wear that earring in your nose?&quot; Oh, the joys of the retail industry.<BR>

<B>LOCK, STOCK &amp; TWO SMOKING BASTARDS</B><BR>
<BR>
On the whole, I was a good employee. I always turned up on time, I was clean, hygienic, pleasant to my customers, in fact I got along hilariously with most of them. I got along with the other employees, I was a quick, sharp worker, it was a crappy job but I did it well. Just had problems with the &quot;management&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Anna Pisses Off Undisclosed Department Store #1: New Beginnings</B><BR>
<BR>
Job interview. Way to take charge from the start. First thing I'm asked when I step in the door is &quot;Do you always wear that earring in your nose?&quot; I reply with an emphatic &quot;Yes. I do.&quot; Stilted silence. The woman who is interviewing me has wild, unruly hair, about an inch thick plaster of makeup and enough costume jewellery to sink a ship. She also has badly nicotine-stained fingers. She makes a point of looking me up and down. I hate that. After reading through my r&ordf;sum&ordf;, asking a few standard questions regarding why the hell I'm applying for a job at a retail store, we again perform a full circle back to the topic of the nose stud. <BR>
<BR>
Her: Is there any way you could possibly take that out for work? <BR>
<BR>
Me: Why should I? <BR>
<BR>
Her: It says in our handbook. Standard Dress Code. Business-like appearance. No body piercing. <BR>
She pulls out a copy of the document, I take a quick look and push it aside. <BR>
<BR>
Me: Look, if you're not going to give me this job because I have a piece of metal in my nose as opposed to my ear, just tell me now so I can leave. <BR>
<BR>
Pause. <BR>
<BR>
Her: I'll check with the manager, give me a second. <BR>
I sit in the small room alone for a few minutes reading the walls. This woman is a fan of lame humour. Cool. <BR>
<BR>
She peeps her head around the doorframe. <BR>
<BR>
Her: When can you start? <BR>
<BR>
Me: Woo! <BR>
<BR>
<B>Anna Pisses Off Undisclosed Department Store #2: The Sequel </B><BR>
<BR>
It's not a bad job. It's not incredibly thrilling, but it's providing me with money and something to do. The other girls I'm working with (why were there only ever girls?) are all a couple of years older than me so I actually get along with them. My stuporviser, Justina, is a bit of a moron, but she means well all the same. Kind of like a Barbie on 'roids, hah. Come to one of the half-yearly big-ass sales where everything is marked down by at least 20%. The store is packed. Overweight bumpkins come from far and wide to take advantage of the occasion. Damn yokels. This one couple is coming through the checkouts and for some daft reason some of the items aren't being automatically marked down by the computer so I have to work them out manually. Aaaarrghhh!! *warning bells* Man, put it this way, I'm not exactly known for my mathematical prowess. In fact, I suck at maths. So I'm standing there, slowly working these deductions out when the male yokel pipes up:<BR>
 <BR>
Him: $5.65. <BR>
<BR>
Me: Pardon? <BR>
<BR>
Him: $5.65. That's the amount you need to take off.<BR>
 <BR>
Me: Oh, thank you, Sir. I'll just make sure on the calculator. <BR>
<BR>
Him: It's $5.65. Just take off $5.65<BR>
.<BR>
Me: Sorry Sir, but I have to work it out on the calculator. That's the protocol. <BR>
<BR>
Him: For God's sake it's $5.65! <BR>
<BR>
Woman Yokel enters. <BR>
<BR>
Her: Leave the girl alone, George. She's been told to do it this way, so leave her be. <BR>
<BR>
Him: But all she has to do is take off $5.65! Stupid checkout mumble mumble if I were in charge mumble mumble back in my day&tilde; mumble grumble blah zeepin rottin blah... <BR>
<BR>
By this time I'm really fucked off. <BR>
<BR>
Me: Excuse me Sir, but just because I work at a checkout does not mean I am bereft of intelligence. I would appreciate it if you did not attempt to do my job for me and shut up so I could complete this transaction with your wife. *ping* That'll be $248.50, thank you. How would you like to pay for this? WITH COW PATS?! <BR>
<BR>
About 15 minutes later Justina calls me over to inform me that I've had a complaint made about me and that I have to go up to see the manager. What did I have to say for myself? (My god, she sounded like an irate mother).<BR>
<BR>
Me: It was $5.45. I saved them 20 cents.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Anna Pisses Off Undisclosed Department Store #3: Trilogies Are So Last Millennium</B><BR>
<BR>
About 3 months later into the scheme of things, the current secretary decides she's going on leave down the Gold Coast for a couple of weeks. They needed to find a new one, so they ask me &ldquo; to save out on paying a temp. I've never had any experience with reception work before but I think what the hell, could be fun, so agree to begin training. Training turns out to be eight hours of quickly being shown the ropes by a bitchy plastic blonde on Friday, only to begin three weeks of full-time work on Monday. Eight hours of training and I have to know everything about the store I've only partially worked at for a few measly months? What the?? So it's eight hours down the track and I reason that for the same amount of pay I could be performing menial tasks back down at the checkouts, but having a wonderfully good time chatting up passing customers. So I tell them to get knotted. They have to pay more for a temp. There's that constipated look of anger again... <BR>
<BR>
<B>Anna Pisses Off Undisclosed Department Store #4: The Final Showdown </B><BR>
<BR>
Christmas comes and goes. I don't get many hours due to the overwhelming supply of cheap 15-year-old labour, so I grow a little bitter. Not having much to do and in the possession of an unusually large amount of money, I decide to go a-tripping to the local tattoo parlour. I'm bored &ldquo; thread a needle through my eyebrow and insert a sparkly silver ring, I wanna know what it looks like. Wahoo, it's a keeper! Go on vacation for a couple of weeks sporting latest piercing, get the obligatory knock to the head and sport the matching yellow bruising. Get back, everything's all fine and dandy, great New Year's, everyone didn't die due to Y2K and life is good. Ring work up, inform them that I'm back, wait for call so I can get back to work. Finally I get a shift &ldquo; on the door. Blergh. There's only one job more pitiful than being a checkout chick and that's being a meet 'n' greet bag inspector. But I go anyway, coz I mean it pays. Rock up, sign in, secretary looks at me funny, I smile at her, walk down to the front of the store. Who should I be replacing but Crazy Hair Woman herself. <BR>
<BR>
Her: What's that on your eyebrow? <BR>
<BR>
Me: An eyebrow ring. <BR>
<BR>
Her: Is it permanent? <BR>
<BR>
Me: Yes. (duh) <BR>
<BR>
Her: Michelle, can you stand on the door for a moment? Anna, come with me. <BR>
<BR>
Damn. I guess I saw this coming. We walk up to management and I sit down in her office while she undoubtedly goes in seek of the Big M. They both return, Big M taking a final drag of her cigarette, (I thought it was illegal to smoke in the workplace?) speaks. <BR>
<BR>
Her: Anna, we hired you under the pretence that you were to get no more facial piercings. <BR>
<BR>
Me: You never said that. <BR>
<BR>
Her: (sidestep) It says in the manual you are to have no body piercings apart from one stud or small sleeper in each ear. <BR>
<BR>
Me: You hired me with a nose stud. <BR>
<BR>
Her: (sidestep) Where is it going to stop Anna? You could come into work tomorrow and have another ring in your lip. <BR>
<BR>
Me: I'm quite happy with the piercings I have at the moment, but thank you for the suggestion. <BR>
<BR>
Her: Don't get sarky with me Anna. <BR>
<BR>
Cool. She said sarky.<BR>
<BR>
Me: Well, what are you getting at?<BR>
<BR>
Her: I'm sorry it's come down to this, but if you don't take out your eyebrow ring we're going to have to let you go. <BR>
<BR>
Let me go, hey. I don't think so, I'll quit before you fire me. Wait up, no I wont, I want unfair dismissal. Hmm&tilde; <BR>
<BR>
Me: What's the difference between an eyebrow ring and an earring? Apparent social standards? <BR>
<BR>
Her: It's not an image the company would like to project. We have standards here, you know.<BR>
 <BR>
Pause. <BR>
<BR>
More pause. <BR>
<BR>
Seethe. Bubble. Overflow. <BR>
<BR>
Me: Well then fuck your standards! Fuck your company! You pathetic band of conservative anal-retentive bastards! You seriously think I'm going to give up my freedom of self expression just because some dickhead up top thinks it's unfit for public consumption? Well fuck you! I'm a good fucking employee. I'm neat, I'm hygienic, why should a small piece of metal make any difference? Hell, half your customers probably have piercings of their own, or have children who have piercings, or just don't give a flying fuck because they have a fucking life! I'm ringing the union. Fuck you! <BR>
(or something like that)<BR>
<BR>
I didn't ring the union. I'm too bloody lazy to ring the union. I did, however, bitch a lot about the situation and refuse to buy anything from the company ever again. Lasted about two months. They have very competitively priced videos&tilde; So much for principles. *snort*<BR>
<BR>
<B>Afterthought</B><BR>
In retrospect, seems like an attempt to promo myself as an anarchistic bitch-ass alterna-wank. I hate that. And it's so not what I set out to do. It's like hey, look at me, I'm cool coz I stuck it to the man. Ergh. Which I didn't, really. What I did do was get my ass fired. And now I have no job. That's not cool. Although they really were bastards&tilde; Anyway, just letting you know that I'm not endeavouring to portray some smarter-than-thou class struggler whose sole purpose in life is to battle it out for the underground (or something). I think I'm too aware to be that lame. At least I hope I am.<BR>
