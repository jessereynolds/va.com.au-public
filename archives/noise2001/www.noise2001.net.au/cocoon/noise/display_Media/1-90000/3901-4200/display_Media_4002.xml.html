&quot;Dear D, is there a kitty heaven?&quot;<BR>

<B>DISAPPEARING PILLARS</B><BR>
<BR>
I remember when I was about eight crying over the fact that Mum had replaced the old rubbish bin with a new one without telling me. A rubbish bin - a cylindrical barrel of plastic for gods sake, but it'd been the only one I'd known my whole life and I freaked when I found an unfamiliar one in it's place. I think I've always clung to inane objects for a sense of stability; possibly to replace my constant itch that the world's going to fall to pieces at any second. You see, if certain people and/or possessions are still intact, then everything's going to be okay, everything's normal and a firm grasp on reality remains. So the disappearing rubbish bin scared me. It used to be the same with living patterns as well. I couldn't relax, or even function, if I hadn't hung up my towel in the bathroom a certain way, or if I hadn't placed the toys on my bed in a certain way, or if I hadn't blinked a certain number of times after looking in the mirror, or if I hadn't checked the deck for strange men walking around before I went to bed, or any number of things. I guess everyone has their own idiosyncrasies, but I'm pretty sure that at times it surpassed habit and was verging on obsessive compulsive. Again, seeking a form of stability to soften the general feeling of instability. <BR>
<BR>
So why did I feel unstable in the first place? You tell me. My pre-pubescent childhood couldn't have been more ordinary if my parents had tried. (Although since age eleven I haven't lived in the same city for more than two years at a time - but that's quite irrelevant at this stage, just amusing). We lived within a ten-minute walk of both sets of grandparents; we were a tightknit family and a happy one at that. I was a smart kid and did noticeably above average in school, was involved in ballet, drama, gifted-kid bullshit classes and played hockey and the clarinet - busy, yet balanced. Life was schmick. But I still had this constant foreboding sensation that at any moment all hell was going to break loose and time was going to cave in on itself and we'd all cease to exist. HAHA FUN! So I kept it all in order through ritual. Rituals create stability, which creates a feeling of safety. Safety from...? I dunno, I'm not up with the psychoanalysis, but I do know that I got over it. The feeling's still there but it's pushed way back and I dropped the routines. Heh, I actually remember once going to place the towel on the rack and fiddle around with it the way I normally did to get it sitting 'in that way', then thinking to myself: &quot;This isn't normal, just leave it.&quot; And I did. I spent the rest of the day thinking about it, but after a few weeks of ignoring my impulses, the stress disappeared. I used the somewhat cold-turkey method on all of my habits and gradually began to feel a general sense of ease. <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, the reason I got onto this (although now it's kind of hard to see the connection) is because today, Leo passed away. I'm cool with it, I could see it coming. In fact, I'm not upset at all... which is weird. He was sick, he had been for a couple of years now, but it wasn't life threatening or even painful for that matter. Just sick. Over the past few months it was becoming quite obvious he was nearing dementia. He used to lie all day with his head under the curtain, when I took him outside he'd just walk around in tight circles and he had this slapping thing he'd do with his tongue&tilde; just small mental upsets. (Not to mention the fact you could just see it in his eyes.) Anyway, they performed an exploratory operation on him this morning because none of the tests were showing why he wasn't eating (I think they were looking for cancer) and sometime during this, he stopped breathing. They kept him on a respirator for the rest of the op but by the end he was braindead. So this arvo we had him euthanaised and yeah, I guess that's the end of the story. <BR>
<BR>
Connection with previous memory = stable entity now gone. But I'm not crying. A rubbish bin I cry about, but Leo I don't. Granted, I'm now twelve years older, but it's still the same deal. Bleh, enough pondering over this, I'm gonna go write something stupid to clear my mind.<BR>
<BR>
Better to die, and sleep<BR>
The never-waking sleep, than linger on<BR>
And dare to live when the soul's life is gone. <BR>
- Sophocles<BR>
