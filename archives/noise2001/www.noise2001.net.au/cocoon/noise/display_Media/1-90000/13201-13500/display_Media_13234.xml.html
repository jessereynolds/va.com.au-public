I fell in love with a girl. And I told her how I felt. And she returned the love. But she was also taken. And this is the story about that girl.<BR>
<BR>
--<BR>
<BR>
<B>My Friend Bethany</B><BR>
<BR>
We had been in a play together.<BR>
<BR>
She had played the popular girl and I had played the comic relief. We were good friends, and we used to waltz, I can remember the waltzing. And then the play ended, about which I was sad about because the play had become my entire life. At the after party, Bethany left early, and I felt a feeling that made me wonder. Was it the play I missed, or was it Bethany? Had I been so foolish enough to have no known what I had until it was gone? I thought so. The more I thought about Bethany, the more my heart hurt, the more my heart hurt the more I drank, the more I drank the more violent I became with the crowbar someone had foolishly handed me at the after party. Something about gauging the dog's eyes out seemed so...soothing.<BR>
<BR>
A week later I got an e-mail from Bethany. She was worried about me. I hadn't been myself since the end of the play. There is something about sitting at a computer with these beautiful words there, and then something oddly calming about writing. It is good therapy. So I wrote exactly what I felt, the confusion down. And then, in an act of stupidity? An act of confession? A plea for help? I pressed send.<BR>
<BR>
She sent me a poem that made me cry in the library at school in front of people. Everyone thought that I may have finally lost it. Gone mad. I am the party theatrical one, it seems just to believe that I'd also be the first one to lose my marbles and cry at school. I was falling in love with someone that I shouldn't be, and only I knew that, only me and Bethany. When I saw her again I was scared. I was scared about what she would see in my eyes, and what I would see in hers -- something that perhaps I didn't want to see. I was heartbroken and so was she. Her wrote to me and told me that all she could see was my face, and it wasn't even looking at her. But I fixed it. I went up to her and I hugged her. And she made me promise never to leave her.<BR>
<BR>
But she was still with her boyfriend. I don't know. But she was. I was hurting, she was hurting. She didn't want to hurt anyone. I had put her in a terrible siuation. I am a bastard. Why the fuck did I do that to someone that I care about?! Maybe I really have lost it. I was talking to a friend, Jessikah, and she told me that I am being selfish. That I AM a batard. That what I am doing is the worst thing that someone can do to someone else. And so I called her. I called her and I told her to take one day to live for herself. To worry about Bethany. Not about me. Not about her boyfriend. Not about her parents. But to take one day. Just to be happy for herself for one day. And in that one day everything will become clear and she will make the right desicion for her own happiness. She told me that her day is going to be Saturday. That is tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
And I don't know what she will choose. <BR>
<BR>
But the thought of her smiling because she is truly happy.<BR>
<BR>
I'm willing to risk everything, just to see that.&nbsp;
