A non-fiction article looking at the various meanings and idiosyncracies of mix tapes. It includes responses from musicians, zinesters and anyone suffering from mix tape disorder.<BR>

<B>MIXED RESPONSE: why a compilation tape is more than just 90 minutes of noise</B><BR>
<BR>
Why do we make mix tapes? Is the High Fidelity philosophy of compilation-making<BR>
true? And what is that song after track four on side B?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PLAY. RECORD.  When I was seven, my father bought a portable stereo -- a surrogate for the never-working tape player in the car. We hooked it up to the cigarette lighter and my dad taught me something that threw my world slightly off-kilter (or condemned me to a life spent hovering above tape decks -- it depends on how you look at it.) He told me what happened when you pressed the play and record buttons together. This priceless knowledge led to school years squished next to an awkward slab of hi-fi technology, arm sore from mid-air what if they play a good song next? suspension. This happened most often at home, in the fireplace. (Yes, I sat in the fireplace, but that's where the stereo system was placed. Our fireplace was more a hole in the wall, than a heating facility.) I remember my increasing frustration over never getting a proper version of Sinead O'Connors song, 'Nothing Compares 2 U'. I really did hate songs which started with the lyrics, right off the bat. That didn't mean I didn't want them on tape though.<BR>
<BR>
When I say that my dad taught me what happened when you simultaneously press play and record, perhaps that's not the whole story. He only told me the technical aspects,  how it was possible to capture exact sound sequences on the glossy brown surface of spooling tape. As Rob, High Fidelitys' mix-tape authority, could tell you, recording a music compilation has meanings and consequences that go beyond the mere transfer of sound.<BR>
<BR>
PAUSE. REWIND. When you hear an old song, you're often eclipsed by a distinct set of sensations -- an 80's summer anthem recalls the staccato shivers you had, as your parents dried you with a sand-textured towel; that You Am I song evokes the ripe evening smell of wet pavements -- a scent like a shot of menthol to your head as you walked to a place that's now no longer home. So with their lengthy set lists, mix tapes can bring on a heady traipse down memory lane. Putting on an old mix tape is like flicking through an old diary -- people, scenes, paraphernalia that particularise a long-gone moment in you life lose their distance, and swim into a crisp, warm focus.<BR>
<BR>
On 'Art of the Mix', a website dedicated to mixtapes, it says 'compilations reflect a period of time, a sense of place, emotional states, aesthetic sensibilities. Mix tapes are also, a kind of creative act as well as a record of a series of decisions at a particular moment in time.'<BR>
<BR>
Mandy Joy, from the Cat Power Internet mailing list, says that she and her friends use mix tapes to sum up their year. They each record a compilation which best reflects their personal musical interests of the past twelve months, and produce enough copies to give to each other. On New Years Eve, they meet up and swap compilations. Not only is it an annual tradition she says it's also, an interesting way for us to get to know each other better.<BR>
<BR>
Steven Venn, also from the Cat Power mailing list, had a similar custom. He would make a tape with The X-Files as the theme and give it to a friend for Christmas. In between the tracks were sound sequences he sampled from the show. Despite having a falling out with this friend, The X-Files still makes him think of her.<BR>
<BR>
Steven also entered his compilation tape into a contest sponsored by Maxell. It was chosen by CMJ as the tape of the month in August 1998. He later gave the mix tape to a girl he had met at his sister's wedding. 'She said it was very cool ... yet she still married someone else later. Awww, I didn't hold it against her. Funny this tape still reminds me of her though', he says.<BR>
<BR>
HIGH FIDELITY.<BR>
In High Fidelity, when Rob (John Cusack) says that the sole point of compilation tapes is to crack onto someone, my stomach lurched. Tapes as amorous devices? If this were true, I surely was up for Jerry Springer guest-status given the mountains of compiles I had given to people over the last few years.<BR>
<BR>
Or perhaps not. Perhaps this was some quirky Northern Hemisphere practice: have summer in June, produce boy bands aplenty, and seduce via bulkbought C90s.<BR>
<BR>
Actually, it's not the idea of using tapes for romantic purposes that bothers me -- but the musical compilations being misconstrued as (multiple!) passes.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, fretting about such interpretation is needless if no-one subscribes to the High Fidelity philosophy of mix tape making. So how many actually do? I decided to ask and find out.<BR>
