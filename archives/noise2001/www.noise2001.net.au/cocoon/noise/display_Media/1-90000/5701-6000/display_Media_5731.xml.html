A 1500-word article on the strange food, strange places, <BR>
and strange venues bands write about in their tour diaries.<BR>
<BR>
<B>If Samuel Pepys Had a Rider: bands and their tour diaries</B><BR>
<BR>
At Moles club in Bath two nights later, the stage is so low and the room so packed that I am singing directly into the forehead of the man in front of me. <BR>
-Everything But The Girl tour diary, 1994<BR>
<BR>
Yep, the tour diary, a paean to the joys of travelling, heaving equipment onstage to play to three people, roadside 'food'  the peculiarities of new places and the fun of playing venues the size of a sewing thimble. Initially a ubiquitous fanzine feature, the tour diary has now evolved into an online band homepage staple. Search for 'tour diary' on Yahoo! and you'll get some several-digited number of matches in return . So why is there an overwhelming amount of bands who need to scribe down details of on-the-road encounters in the name of posterity? Are they trying to channel Jack Kerouac? (Or more likely, Bridget Jones?) Regardless of the reason, the written result is often funny, fascinating, and quite a bloody good read.  <BR>
<BR>
Many themes crop up in any band's tour diary. One of the most dominant themes being, of course, the idiosyncrasies of place. Says Mercury Rev's Adam Snyder about L.A., 'Here the tyranny of cigarette smoke finally abates so that we can breathe the collective pollutants of automobiles head-on without distraction'. After the first song on Def Leppard's Indonesian tour, the power goes off and doesn't return for 15 minutes. It doesn't help that they aren't allowed to take their shirts off in the scorching temperature, due to the local censorship laws. Whilst in Cleveland, Bette Midler visits the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame, a museum which houses a cub scout uniform once owned by Mr. Jim Morrison and one of John Lennon's school report cards. 'He flunked everything and his teacher said he wouldn't amount to anything. I guess there is hope for George W', quips Ms. Midler.<BR>
<BR>
Local food is also a prominent theme among rock diarists alike. In his Big Black final tour diary, Steve Albini makes well-known his revulsion for Thirst Lifesavers, describing the Australian confectionery as a cross between blood plasma and dried urine, and concluding that its existence is a prank that locals play on Americans. In the U.S., Arnold are treated to mashed potato pizza by their record company. The U.K. band also find out that you can obtain milk for free from American McDonald's outlets. When you ask for said dairy product at 'McCardboard Box' -- as Ben from Bluebottle Kiss calls them --  the computer screen registers zero dollars and the cashier can't charge you for it. (This observation was probably cut from Pulp Fiction as it didn't have enough swearing in it.) One of the stops during Fuck's autumn tour of 1997 is Charlottesville, renowned for its sushi. Despite the low price and wonderful quality of said food, they 'stick to the vegetarian offerings, because contrary to what Curt (or Kurt or Kurdt or whatever he called himself) said, fish do have feelings, and most of the time they are pissed off about being eaten.' <BR>
