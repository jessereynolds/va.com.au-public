A 600-word article profiling a series of backyard gigs that have been taking place in Sydney called 'Underneath The Clothesline'.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Underneath the Clothesline: Underneath The Spotlight</B><BR>
<BR>
Unless you're a fan of Rex Hunts Fishing World, the best thing you can do on a Sunday is head over to an Underneath The Clothesline gig. <BR>
<BR>
Well, that's the sentiment from patrons and organisers of a series of backyard gigs currently taking place in inner Sydney. The Underneath The Clothesline shows have been a regular occurrence on the indie calendar since their inception in April last year. Organisers Darren Hanlon and Stefan Zagorski started up the series as an alternative to what the live scene presently offers. Several shows later, from Chippendale to Lewisham, Underneath The Clothesline has won over fans and bands alike.<BR>
<BR>
It's not hard to see why. Staged on Sunday afternoons in a cosy suburban backyard setting, Underneath The Clothesline has an atmospheric charm. Band members sit with the audience before playing on a stage only footsteps away. Kids run around, homemade biscuits are sold, and early spectators may witness volunteers running the barbecue in preparation for the tofu burgers to be offered later. It contrasts vividly to the average pub gig. Instead of sticky floors, there are picnic blankets; instead of hecklers, there are neighbours' barking dogs' instead of stage lighting, there's sunshine, or in the case of the final bands -- dusky twilight. <BR>
<BR>
One headlining band, Sea Life Park, responded to this lack of light by making fun of their inability see their instruments. Did they see it as a detraction? No, the situation just added to the party-like atmosphere. Says Lee Hillam, the band's lead singer, 'the dark, the crazy dogs, the weird no foldback P.A. situation, the kids that dance, all contribute to that'.<BR>
<BR>
However, Underneath The Clothesline is more than just a fun day out. The gigs are a response to some problems in the live scene at the moment -- particularly the lack of all ages shows. Zagorski, who also runs Quietly Suburban Records, points out that, 'there are no regular all ages shows in Sydney, and there seems to be a lot of red tape for the venues to be able to put them on. The last all ages show I tried to put on, in a pub environment, they asked for $500 upfront. I knew the show probably wouldn't even make that much.'<BR>
<BR>
Juice's Bronwyn Thompson agrees that Underneath The Clothesline has widened the opportunities for underaged patrons, as well as, 'those who have a hard time traveling to shows at night.'<BR>
<BR>
The accessibility of the shows, however, is restricted by its low-key nature. The gigs are only advertised via word-of-mouth and Internet mailing lists such as Quietly Suburban and Nothing Happening. However, some might see this as less a question of elitism, and more a logical response to how many people can be squeezed in someone's backyard. <BR>
<BR>
The geographical scope of the gigs have also come under the spotlight. The shows have been concentrated on the inner-city, as those who live out of the area have pointed out, and some would like to see a variation in locations. Perhaps this will be soon addressed, as backyards from Mosman and Wollongong have been offered for staging gigs, and may be used in the future.<BR>
<BR>
So, given the success and support for Underneath The Clothesline, is the backyard gig likely to replace its pub counterpart? Charles McPhedran, who hosts 2SER's local music show Osmosis argues that, 'it is absolutely paramount that backyard gigs and pub gigs operate in concert; with only one of the two it is simply not financially viable for interstate bands to travel to Sydney.'<BR>
<BR>
In contrast, Hillam sees backyard shows as an attraction to individuals who don't attend all-ages or licenced gigs, such as people with small kids, or people with an aversion to sitting in a dark enclosed space on a sunny Sunday afternoon, or your parents.<BR>
