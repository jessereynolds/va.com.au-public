A short story about the changing face of campus activism.<BR>
<BR>
---<BR>
<BR>
<B>I'D RATHER GO NAKED THAN...</B><BR>
<BR>
while browsing at my local shops, a collection of chanting voices catch my attention. And soon enough a large group of young people come into view, marching down the street in some kind of protest action. Traffic is banked up and anger flows from the drivers, but not near the amount of vitriol that flows from these activists. I can't decipher the tune to which they march, but it carries the air of an atypical old style protest song. My curiosity is piqued and I move closer, trying to understand the fuss, and I see that their uniform, a utilitarian black shirt and blue denim combo, is the same as what I happen to be wearing today. When the group is nearby, before I have a chance to completely comprehend the fuss, they draw me in as one of their own, and a short, elfin girl hands me a banner which reads 'those in the know will not have to go', which she tells me to hold high and wave with pride. I take the banner and hesitatingly do so. <BR>
<BR>
It's not too long before I begin to forget about the why's of this action, and take pleasure in the now's: - a good beginning for any kind of activism, I feel. The eventual disruption, however, makes everything clear. Just before I finally decipher the words to the protest song,  a tall man with a pair of cheekbones higher than my eyeline catches sight of me, and calls to the marchers at the head of the group to stop. I down my flag and, without knowing enough to really feel in fear, I'm still struck by the stomach churn any imposter feels when found out. As this man, confronting in his good looks, let alone the situation, walks towards me, the tune I had been hearing becomes clear. Not just a protest song from a bygone decade, but also the song in an advertising campaign currently screening for designer clothing. The man now stands next to me and looks at my arse, and orders the others to do so also. They mill about, catching a view of my rear, clad in simple dark denim jeans from a department store,  and begin to angrily murmur. Swiftly, some of the marchers form a line, turn, and point their butts towards me. I am momentarily bathed in a glow of designer tags, far pricier than my own dusty keks. The leader punches me in the stomach and I fall to one knee, searching for a breath.  <BR>
<BR>
I have stumbled upon a march through the city by the newly formed 'students against poorly dressed students' society, a mark of the new era of pay-per-place universities, where the underclass on campus is defined by a lack of heavy label clothing and personalised ring-tones on email connected mobiles.  Those in the street are fair game too, as I seem to be right now. <BR>
<BR>
So as the first boot slides into my teeth I make a mental note to head into the city and, after visiting the dentist, to visit the mall and get up to speed with the new order. <BR>
