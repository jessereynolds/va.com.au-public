&quot;Most people collect some kind of object, or some kind of knowledge, no matter how colourless and standard they appear. One of my favourite things to collect is conversations with strangers.&quot;<BR>

<B>COLLECTING, FOR BEGINNERS</B><BR>
<BR>
He was one of those people who looks entirely misplaced, no matter what their surroundings are, it was the middle of winter and he wore shorts and a t-shirt, like he was about to go to the beach. He had a strange walk, he sort of jiggled along with his hands in his pockets, possibly because he was cold.<BR>
But I don't think so, he looked too dubious to have been doing it for a normal reason. Within three sentences, I knew he was going to trap me into having a conversation. It started off innocently enough, he asked if this was the bus stop. A stupid question to ask when you're standing right under the yellow sign with a picture of a bus on it, spoken merely to break the silence.<BR>
By answering &quot;Yes&quot; I must have tacitly agreed to have him question me. He started -<BR>
&quot;Are you Egyptian?&quot; he asked.<BR>
&quot;What?&quot; I replied, too surprised not to sound rude.<BR>
&quot;You look Egyptian,&quot; he said<BR>
&quot;No, I'm not Egyptian,&quot; I replied<BR>
&quot;Where are you from?&quot; he asked.<BR>
&quot;Around the corner,&quot; I said.<BR>
It's embarrassing when your dud jokes fall flat. He didn't understand and asked me if I had been born around the corner, to which I sighed and said no, that was where I lived. After a bit more explanation of my rather standard ancestry he moved onto his next topic.<BR>
&quot;Are you married?&quot;<BR>
&quot;Yes,&quot; I lied, &quot;Yes, I am married.&quot;<BR>
This seemed to get him going, he had this jerky half-nervous way of speaking that was almost a stutter.<BR>
&quot;So you'd have kids about my age then?&quot; he asked. He looked about 18.<BR>
&quot;Errr, no.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Why not?&quot;<BR>
&quot;Because I'm 22.&quot; I examined this guy more closely, and realised he wasn't really looking at me, his eyes appeared unfocussed, staring off to one side of me, past me, the type of look that you notice in people with very bad eyesight. After asking me how long I had been married for, to which I replied three years, he launched into this long speech about marriage, and, as he referred to it, screwing around. He asked me all these questions: if I reckoned many young marriages end in divorce, and whether married people find it hard to be monogamous; none of which I answered. He didn't seem to mind that I obviously didn't want to talk to him. He spoke as if there was no question of him being silent and he had to speak on these matters, whether anyone was there to listen or not.<BR>
He started to tell me about one of his friends, this guy who picks up at least two different girls every week to have his way with and how this friend has all these ladies trying to hold him down in a relationship and having fights with one another over him, constantly. His friend had some kind of magnetism that women could not resist. He specified that this was what it was like where he lived, near the beaches, that the people over there were far more promiscuous. I wondered whether he was wearing board shorts and a T-shirt because he lived near the beach, a uniform to show his origins, even though it was freezing cold. It made me think of Sydney divided up into all these different sectors, each with a distinctly different mode of dress and behaviour. This was obviously how this guy thought. He started to ask me, just as an aside, what I did and when I said I was a writer, because I could not think of a creative lie he asked me if I live the hippy way of life.<BR>
&quot;People around here are a bit hippyish, aren't they? You know, into free love and stuff. But even though they're into free love they still have morals and pride, unlike my mates at the beach.&quot;<BR>
His mates at the beach went to nightclubs and had a lot of casual sex, he told me, it was different around the beaches. He made a grossly exaggerated movement looking up the road and then said to me &quot;You look out for the bus, okay?&quot; as if we were some kind of team. <BR>
He asked me if I had ever picked up a guy at a club and had sex with him without knowing him at all. I decided to lie and told him, yes, I had.<BR>
He started to jiggle round a bit more and asked how old I was when I did this. I picked a number, 17.<BR>
&quot;That's young,&quot; he said. &quot;That kind of thing has never happened to me.&quot;<BR>
There was a bit of a silence and I noticed, mercifully, the bus approaching, and I stood up and hailed it with much vigour and a little desperation. Most of the seats were taken but I found one towards the back behind a man with shoulders wide enough to hide me. The guy took ages buying a ticket and I peeked out from the side of one of the shoulders to catch him looking around for me, in this strange squinting half blind way. He sat down at the front of the bus for about five seconds before coming to find me. I shrunk down in my seat but within half a minute he was sitting beside me. He said, very loudly:<BR>
&quot;Can I just ask you something? When you were 17 and screwing guys like that, do you think a lot of girls are like that at that age?&quot;<BR>
I was mortified. People turned to stare at me, the question having been loudly delivered into the enclosed space of the bus, for everyone to hear. They all wanted a look at the promiscuous girl. Before I had a chance to answer he told me he thought women of 30 were more that way inclined, because he watched the show Sex and the City and that is what the characters on that show were like. He told me he thought it was a really honest program, really true to life. I told him I didn't have a television, to try and shut him up. That kind of excuse is on a par with &quot;No you can't call me, I don't have a phone,&quot; for bluntness, but he didn't take my hint. I didn't expect him to at this stage, but it was interesting to see just how rude I could be before he realised it. He went on about how honest Sex and the City was and then, suddenly, in the middle of a sentence interjected with:<BR>
&quot;Cor! Can you smell that homeless guy?&quot; There was a trampy-looking fellow at the back of the bus, crumpled down in the seat, muttering. &quot;They all smell the same!&quot; he said, before launching into another speech about how he didn't know how to help them, how he couldn't help them by adopting their lifestyle. &quot;If I didn't wash, that wouldn't help them&quot; he said, a strange argument.<BR>
&quot;I'm unemployed at the moment,&quot; he said, &quot;though I've just started a business with one of my mates, selling racehorses. We haven't sold any yet.&quot; I didn't know what to think. He looked about 18, he had braces on his teeth, was wearing summer clothes in winter, had very promiscuous friends, sold racehorses for a living and seemed to have very bad eyesight. I was sitting next to a truly lost person. He was bragging about how corrupt the racehorse industry was, how anything to do with gambling meant there was a lot of money involved, and he had to deal with people who would kill you or kneecap you if you did anything they didn't like. He told me about races being rigged so horses would get good reputations and how he had been studying books about horse breeding. He said his mate was a jockey and couldn't read or write, so he had to do a lot of the work for him. This was a safer topic of conversation, I didn't feel as threatened by his name-dropping of racehorses.<BR>
<BR>
I knew I had to wait until he got off the bus before I could, regardless of whether I had gone past my stop or not. The thought of this guy following me around for the rest of the night, bleating about screwing around was a terrible one.<BR>
There was a pause in his racehorse banter and he then said &quot;Isn't it dangerous to sleep with strangers?&quot;, to which I uttered an audible sigh and said something like &quot;You do not have to abandon all sense in the face of passion. You can be sensibly frivolous.&quot; He paused and asked me what frivolous meant, whilst looking wildly around to find out where he was, whether he was approaching his stop. He stood up, still talking as he stepped down the stairs, about marriage again and I saw his face astounded when the driver shut the doors and the bus drove away, cutting him off in mid sentence. Maybe he had expected I was going to come with him.<BR>
I thought of the lies I had told him. In his mind, I had been created as a young wife with a promiscuous past, who lives the hippy way of life and looks Egyptian, a picture absolutely removed from myself, from the truth. We both had completely distorted mental pictures of each other. I meet people like that and immediately wonder where they must live and what their house looks like and their favourite things. He didn't seem like a real person, more like someone in a movie with a short but amusing bit part. He probably saw me in much the same way. I felt hidden under the lies I had told him, as I looked back out of the bus window and saw him standing on the sidewalk, looking back and forward like he'd just been dropped out of the sky. &nbsp;
