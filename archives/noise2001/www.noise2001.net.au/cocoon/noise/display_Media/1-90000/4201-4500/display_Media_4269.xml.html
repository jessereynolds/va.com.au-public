So who is directing your life, huh?<BR>

<B>LIFE - PENDING DIRECTION FROM FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA</B><BR>
<BR>
Come on, Coppola. How about this... Shot two, the remorseful girl flees the scene of indiscretion. Point of view of the discarded condom. <BR>
<BR>
I woke up just before noon with a headache, stuffed up sinuses and some dreadlocked strangers arm across my chest. The musty smell of the backpackers was making me want to puke. I could hear conflicting music sparring each other from two dorms, crashing across the hallway in inappropriate decibels. One was trance, bobbing and tinkling through the morning. Trance, in my opinion only belongs at bush parties and in Goa. The other was Dead Kennedy's Too drunk to fuck. Fuck off. That's enough. I dressed quickly and headed out the door.<BR>
<BR>
As I get out into the bright light of the morning, I catch a glimpse of myself in a shop window. My reflection points and laughs. <BR>
<BR>
The first wave of emptiness has retreated from the morning sun, my reflection is still the same.<BR>
<BR>
In Malaysia, there is a trend for designer jeans with bullet holes in them. Famous fashion divas line up pairs of pre-loved jeans from America and shoot them with handguns. The retail price is three-weeks pay. Three-weeks pay to look like you've been shot or maybe not even you. Maybe you're just wearing the jeans of someone who's been shot. Someone meaner than you. Harder than you. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Watch out wife. Today I'm wearing Billy the Kid's jeans, and they're some mighty jeans to fill so don't push me.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Or maybe it's more about mystery; a conversation at a pub:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wow Mister, those look like bullet holes in your jeans&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Maybe so, little lady, there's not much of my life these jeans haven't seen.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The denim-clad man puts another dime in the in the jukebox, honey. Bad bad bad bad boys, you make me feel so good... Sound like a Levi's ad?<BR>
<BR>
There is definitely a market for the suggestion of lifestyle in clothing. I just have to find a designer who will be inspired by a beer-stained T-shirt. Morning optimism! Not yet noon and I have a new business plan.<BR>
<BR>
It's about time for the morning long black so I duck into a cafe with a trendy name and vinyl couches. They're playing Tricky and the smell of coffee, bringer of caffeine, lingers in the air. I order a long black, suture myself to a vinyl couch pick up a magazine and sink into the morning.<BR>
<BR>
My morning meditation and a really interesting article on the world's most intelligent conjoined twins is interrupted when someone sits down next to me and stares in anticipation of a greeting. It's Kevin, a friend from years ago who disappeared to have a consuming love affair. Great, I think as we exchange the standard greetings, all I need this morning is more terrible tales from the tortured heart. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Everything was going fine. I had never been so in love before in my life. Did I tell you how we met?&quot; Kevin wasted no time.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No&quot; I said. Resistance is futile.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was handing my form in. It was a Friday at Centrelink. She was further back in the queue than me, but we we're both staring upwards, towards the television, it was an episode of Bold and the Beautiful, the one where someone is trying to poison Stephanie by putting mercury in her vitamins, but you don't know until later that it's Sheila and Brooke collaborating in a plot to win Ridge and... Anyway, you know.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Actually, no&quot; I begin to think the situation is even worse than I expected, not just a tortured heart tale but also verbal reruns of every soap opera since the 1980s. Kevin was renowned for his obsession with television. I'm surprised he had room in his life for a woman when there was Ricky Lake to consider.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Anyway, our eyes met across the screen and it was love at first sight. I took her back to my house to watch The Munsters Halloween Special on Channel Ten and she never really left. Our days were perfect, bourbon and Jerry Springer, Pizza and pizza. Making love on the couch watching Danielle Steele telemovies. We went out twice a week, once to get pizza and bourbon supplies and once to hand in the form.&quot; Sounds like a fabulous life, cheap wine and a three-day growth; I shudder at the thought. Still it goes to show, it doesn't matter what kind of strange demented psyche you have, someone will always fall in love with it. Sick really.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;One day she came back from the supermarket with a wild smile on her face, she looked a little like a cross between Lana Turner and Jana Wendt. She ran in the door, kissed me on the lips and told me she had signed us up for cable. I was thrilled, I never thought to ask how she could afford it or why...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Kevin began to sob and look upward, in a way that really emphasised the dramatic nature of the story, a trick he learned from Katie Holmes in her portrayal of Joey on Dawson's Creek, no doubt.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Maybe, if I had I would have saved her, maybe if I had just thought about it I could have helped her, but I was blind, I was blinded with happiness. I was in love; I had cable, what else is there. Six months ago last Friday, they arrested her for television piracy, she had been stealing cable, not only for us but also for hundreds of homes across the country. The love of my life was the head of a cable-TV crime syndicate giving free entertainment to the suburbs and beyond. Foxtel wanted to press charges, they locked her up. She didn't say a word to me as they took her from the courtroom, she just looked away. She broke my heart that day,&quot; Kevin sniffed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I heard she had got out early and started a TV addicts twelve step plan, but that's just a rumour. I know we can't be together anymore, but you know, whenever I see a kid with an X-men comic book or a teenager with a Stone Cold Steve Austin shirt, or sometimes when the wind whistles past my ears and it seems to be whistling the theme to Friends, I can hear her name in the second chorus and I can't help whispering back 'I love you'...&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I almost piss myself laughing, but manage to pull together the little sensitivity I have this morning and avoid further indiscretion. <BR>
<BR>
Kevin looks up, sniffs, sips his coffee, looks pensively toward the spot which would contain camera one, then two and three in succession, then closes on a meaningful look to me and a sip on his coffee, a goodbye, then exit. Aaron Spelling could have directed the whole thing. If it had had room for a dancing baby it would have been Ali McBeal. Coppola would definitely cut it, too cheesy, way too cheesy.<BR>
<BR>
It is time for my dose of respectability. My body struggles as I drag it onto the bus for work. Alsation and Associates, a pity job, given to me by my uncle. I make coffee.<BR>
<BR>
It is one o'clock when I arrive. <BR>
<BR>
My uncle is in his office inhaling cigar smoke and exhaling percentages and beige sofas. His lunch is laid out across his desk, she's a blonde. Cut. Cue porn music. Sorry Coppola, this isn't your kind of film.<BR>
<BR>
