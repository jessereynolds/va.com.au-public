&quot;Australia Day long weekend. Friendship. Stupid conversations with your mates. Love, and how it only happens to some of us.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
<B>AUSTRALIA DAY LONG WEEKEND</B><BR>
<BR>
The sun is near the mountains in the late afternoon, but the sky is still a deep blue over the ocean. There are two huge sandy beach towels on the banister, sticky and stiff from this afternoon. They're like wet cardboard; there's not a hope in hell they'll dry before tomorrow, because it's so humid up here. Ian leans on me. &quot;So, go on. You were saying about that guy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nod as I take a gulp of my gin and tonic; I always get distracted when I tell a story and it takes me hours to get back to the original point.<BR>
&quot;So I'm finally in the lift, right, and as soon as the door shuts, he's picking his nose until the split second before it opens on the ground floor.&quot; <BR>
&quot;I do that all the time.&quot; <BR>
&quot;Really?&quot; I said. &quot;Do you give yourself time to flick it before you have to leave the lift?&quot;<BR>
&quot;No.&quot;<BR>
&quot;So what do you do with it?&quot;<BR>
&quot;I roll it up until it's no longer sticky and flick it once I get outside.&quot;<BR>
Ian is smiling into his beer. The outside of the glass is wet; Ian wipes condensation from the top to the bottom in finger widths. He looks like he's joking, but then he also looks embarrassed, so maybe he's telling me this crap and it's the truth. I laugh at him and shake my head. <BR>
&quot;I mean, why don't you just give yourself a second or two before you reach ground, and flick it on the carpet of the lift? That way you don't have to hold on to the little ball the whole way out. A thumb and index fingertip together is a dead giveaway.&quot;<BR>
&quot;For someone who's not a picking sympathiser, you certainly know a lot of details.&quot;<BR>
&quot;I have&oacute; Actually, I was going to say some excuse, but I have none. Oh! Yes I do. I'm open-minded. Yes.&quot; I nod several times while keeping eye contact, sucking on my straw so my cheeks dent.<BR>
&quot;Well how do you do it?&quot; he says, laughing, turning up his palms, reaching his long arms out to me. &quot;Surely you're not saying that your nose is a self-cleaning unit.&quot;<BR>
&quot;No way buddy. I have the most enormous, far-reaching boogers you've ever seen. One was the exact shape of Victoria. They're beyond fingertip reach.&quot;<BR>
Ian laughs so hard he has to sit up and spits out most of the sip he had in his mouth.<BR>
&quot;They are! No, really, Ian, you know, I'm serious now. Literally. So long, I can't get a hook because I just can't reach up that far.&quot; He's still laughing and I can't keep from starting.<BR>
&quot;Ian, please, I'm&oacute; God, you're useless. Are you pissed?&quot; Then I really laugh because I'm the one who's pissed, but then who cares, too hot to care. <BR>
&quot;I can't believe that we've just been talking about&oacute; Oh! You haven't answered! How do you do it?&quot; Ian points at me with one hand, the other with the beer at his open smiling mouth. &quot;You have to answer.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Okay. Because mine are so long,&quot; I swallow, &quot;I actually have to be really clever about getting mine out. You know how apes cover a long reed in honey or sap or whatever and stick it in a termite mound to get the termites out?&quot;<BR>
Ian laughs, nodding. I'm laughing too; I can't believe I'm about to tell my friend some very private information. I breathe in. &quot;I kind of have to do that. I go to the toilet and I twist some toilet paper into a really thin sort of cable? And then that's what I use to do it.&quot;<BR>
&quot;What, you just put it up there?&quot;<BR>
&quot;No, you moron! You don't just put it up there.&quot; We're both trying to finish off this conversation but Ian is laughing too hard to make sense of it and so am I.<BR>
&quot;I&oacute;&quot; I know what I'm about to say and I can't get it out, because we're laughing. &quot;I&oacute; I put the cable in my nostril kind of scrunched but able to be twisted&oacute; Like a torn&oacute; tornado. And winds&oacute; Hhhaa&oacute; It's way up north and picks up all the boogers! Ah! God, my stomach hurts&oacute;&quot; I'm holding onto my sides, I can't breathe for laughing, Ian's neatly wedged himself between the wooden chair he's sitting on and the esky, trying to negotiate the lid.<BR>
Later, we lie with our backs against the wall, Ian's legs are outstretched and mine tuck under me. We say nothing. With the fading sun now behind us, the ocean horizon seems brighter by comparison. Ian's smooth silhouette is black against the blue ocean-sky. Above him, the verandah's trim is inky lace, indistinguishable from the poles, all two dimensions, like black crepe paper. I slide my feet along the old trashed floorboards. I stack one foot on top of the other; they meld perfectly in the black shadows of the pole and disappear. The floorboards end in a line of crooked teeth, on a slight slant against the still straight line of the ocean beyond. <BR>
Below us, Lee and Nat finally pull up in the ute. &quot;Hey gorgeous!&quot; I yell through the floorboards. I pull myself by a pole to lean over the banister.<BR>
Nat looks up with a squint and waves. &quot;Hey! We just spoke to everyone who doesn't wear a pacemaker at the bowls club and two-up is on tonight.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Great. You want some help?&quot; I don't get an answer because they slam front doors and back doors and the boot and yell at each other about keys. Then the whole house shakes as they stomp their way up the rickety wooden stairs, carrying a case of beer over each shoulder. Well, Lee has two but Nat is only carrying one case on one shoulder and using the other hand to keep her sarong closed. <BR>
Ian and I get up to help out, but they rush into the house and dump all the beer straight into the laundry tub. Lee's face is wet from sweat and Nat is threading her long graceful fingers through matted red hair. She walks behind Lee, exasperated.<BR>
&quot;I didn't say that.&quot; She frowns and smiles at the same time, something only Nat knows how to do. It means; you're crazy, I love you, but you're still crazy.<BR>
&quot;You did. You did say that. God, woman. No wonder they're single.&quot; Lee throws an arm in the direction of Ian and I.<BR>
We don't say anything and quietly stand together like children on the edge of the kitchen door and Ian whispers in my ear; &quot;He's going to go into the bedroom, and she's going to say, I married such an arsehole and then she's going to go into the bedroom and you and I will have to go to two-up on our own tonight.&quot;<BR>
Lee leaves the room, passing Nat on his way. In his wake, she yells, &quot;God, I married such an arsehole!&quot; In response, a door is slammed at the other end of the house. <BR>
Ian and I offer her a lame intruder's smile. She shakes her head with her frown-smile and storms past us. She goes to the other end of the house, into their bedroom. We hear some muffled conversation and then nothing. It's the silence that I miss. <BR>
Ian and I stand together in the quiet, darkening kitchen on this hot summer long weekend, in this beautiful old house. We are holding hands. Is there really no one for us? Nat and Lee and Ian and me. We love each other, best friends since uni, we knew we would all love each other always. Years later, though, it's clear that some of us got lucky and some of us didn't. I guess it's the job of the lucky ones to mend the hearts of those who aren't. The lucky ones fly us in from interstate, to let us stay in their happy rambling house and get drunk with us and laugh with us and take us to the bowls club for two-up on Australia Day.<BR>
I guess they mend us one long weekend at a time. <BR>
