I s'pose you could call it a journey of love, being willing to go with someone through the storm as well as the bright days. <BR>
<BR>
This piece focusses on a guy's longing to have his friends understand him, but also his hesitation in having them see him for who he is... vulnerable. <BR>
<BR>
Dunno... sorta deep, sorta shallow... you tell me....<BR>
<BR>
--<BR>
<BR>
<B>DO YOU KNOW WHERE I AM?</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I could show you the land of the living dead, where bones are brittle and stone are sharp underfoot. Words are stark and heavy, haunting and melancholy. The air is cold and dry and grey. Parched hands grasping for the heavens but receiving no rain. Far across the desolate plains the sole voice of a woman cries for her lost love. Then another voice, that of a beggar, ragged and unshaven, holding out his hands for someone or something to fill them. A distant chorus of screaches and wails sound out over the misty hilltops, all with their own agonies bearing down upon your soul.<BR>
<BR>
I am there... sometimes. Sometimes searching for you, sometimes screaming away with hoarse voice, sometimes being snared in the jaws of Oblivion, threatening to swallow me whole.<BR>
<BR>
I could show you this land. It lives in me. But if you were to see it, would you find your way home again? And would you ever come back for me? Would you follow me into the wastelands and wait with me for the rain to come? Would you keep me from the clifftops of the Abyss?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I could show you the open fields of luscious greens, and ocean blue skies, where hearts float on a fragrance of blossom and lavendar. The sun's rays embracing the skin as soft as gossamer. Colours richer and purer than the finest pastels and oils, soaking the landscape with their spectrum. The spirit of children, loved ones, those long departed from the realm of the physical, soaring over the mountains and into pinks and oranges, hues of dusk and the sweetest slumber.<BR>
<BR>
I am there... sometimes. Sometimes trying to catch up to you, sometimes laying down in the grass staring skyward, sometimes looking down on scene before me, feeling the wind in my face and wondering &quot;what next&quot;... <BR>
<BR>
I could show you this land. It lives in me. But if you were to spend a moment there, could you ever believe I've been anywhere else? Would you happily follow me if I left this place of comfort and peace? Will you slow down your flight for me? Or would you leave me amongst all this beauty and have me watch you soar away?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I could show you inside the holiest of places, where light streams in from stained glass windows, and mounted candles maintain their silent vigil. The blood red carpet trodden over approaching one solitary place in the great hall. Overhead, the melodic breeze of an angelic choir sends out a permeating warmth touching the harshest stone and the coldest heart. Hands wrung in desparation, clutched heavenward, petitioning the Almighty for His divine provision.<BR>
<BR>
I am there... sometimes. Sometimes praying for you, sometimes apologising for tarnishing His gift of Grace with my filth, sometimes just wanting to get away from everything else, all the noise that plagues my existence.<BR>
<BR>
I could show you this place. It lives in me. But if you were to sit and kneel with me, would you know what I confess? What cancerous blackness inside my wretched self I ask Him to rid me of? Would you still sit so close to me if you knew? Would you sit by me and hold my hand as I prayed in the holy place? Could you ever understand my sorrow as I seek solace in my God? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I could show you the box of pandemonious noise. Scatterings of old notes, pages of work never finished, phone numbers never called, all kicked about and danced upon. The dark room is spattered with disco glitter, flashing sparks of colour and light, dissappearing a quickly as they came. Dank and smokey air encase all within these four walls. The dizzying lights and bopping, moshing, pulsating bodies, together with the thump thump thumping of some cruddy techno only add to the feeling of claustrophobia that lives in this time-draining place of the Phyiscal.<BR>
<BR>
I am there... sometimes. Sometimes dancing crazily and carefree atop the important things that need doing, sometimes watching the successes and failures of those guys trying to pick up some company for their kicks, sometimes slumped over a table, drunk in the corner watching everything take place in front of me, numb to the world. <BR>
<BR>
I could show you this place. It lives in me. But if you were to come into here and look for me, would you like what you saw? Would you pretend you didn't know me so you didn't have to see me in this state? How would you greet me? With a hug and a smile, or a slight nod and crossed arms? Would you offer to drive me home? How would you treat me after you saw me there?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Would you have thought so much could exist and thrive in me? So much goodness and evil in the same skin deep frame. If I am ever to hide, will you know where to find me? Do you know where I am? Would you seek me amidst and noise and craziness? Amongst the screaming and agony? Floating in the field of dreams? Clutching and cringing from the light?<BR>
<BR>
Would you still know me were I drunk and crazy, or dry and bitter, or sickly and mourning? Or will you only know me when I am surrounded in colour and awash with peace? Will you deny me the warmth of your smile, and the security of your hands in mine? <BR>
<BR>
Do I annoy you? Haunt you? Scare you? Do I lift you up or weigh you down? Do you know where I am? What goes on inside my skin deep frame... where sinister thoughts, delightful dreams, torturing nightmares and heartfelt pleas sound their weary cry.<BR>
<BR>
You know me don't you?<BR>
Can't you stay just a little longer?<BR>
<BR>
Please don't go...<BR>
<BR>
