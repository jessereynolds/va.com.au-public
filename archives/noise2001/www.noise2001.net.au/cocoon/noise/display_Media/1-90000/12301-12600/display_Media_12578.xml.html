I don't think I've been anywhere that's truly silent.<BR>

<BR>
<B>SOUND AND SILENCE</B><BR>
<BR>
1. Bone Conduction<BR>
<BR>
I squished down the ends of the yellow earplugs and carefully inserted them as far into my ear canal as I could, which wasn't that far at all because it was hard to keep a good grip on them before they started to puff back out again.<BR>
<BR>
I'd never worn earplugs before and I had no idea how it was done, but with the aid of the diagrams on the packet and some common sense I was soon enjoying the dulled responses of the outside world. The loud, glorious noises of my own body.<BR>
<BR>
Something that has never ceased to delight me is the fact that there are two ways in which the sound of your voice is transmitted to the delicate inner workings of your ear. One way is from your voice in the air, spoken out into sound waves and collected at the opening of your ears. This is officially and obviously termed 'air transmitted sound'. The other way, the interesting way, is through bone conduction. This is incredibly exciting. The vibrations from your vocal chords go through your skull to your inner ear, all internally. So, for example, when you ring up your own house and get your voice on the answering machine greeting and think 'Err yuck, I don't sound like that,' it is because you are only hearing your voice through air conduction, and the recording process of the answering machine, instead of through your bones as well. So, yes, unfortunately you do sound like that.<BR>
<BR>
The good thing is, that because of bone conduction, you hear your own voice like nobody else does, in your own secret way. With the earplugs in it's the bone conducted component of my voice I can hear dominantly. I can talk quietly and still, through my bones, hear very distinctly what I am saying. Breathing is louder as well, it is like sighing deeply every time I take a breath in or out, and taking a sip of coffee (for example), the whole process becomes more distinct. My throat sounds so productive swallowing, and my teeth clacking together makes a sound like stacking up heavy plates. It feels like my head is enclosed in a sound-magnifying fishbowl, and every second is <BR>
enjoyable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
2. Mrs Kaye<BR>
<BR>
'You didn't write down your extra curricular activities on the sheet, Vanessa.'<BR>
<BR>
Silence.<BR>
<BR>
'Don't you have any?' (She meant ones offered by the school, not what I did when at home, she wanted to hear things like hockey and school plays)<BR>
<BR>
'No.'<BR>
<BR>
'No sports?'<BR>
<BR>
'No'<BR>
<BR>
'Oh!' The poor woman, who I think we had to call Mrs Kaye, was flustered. I couldn't work out if she really did think extra curricular activities were that important and beneficial, but she proceeded to deliver a damning spiel about how it would make me a better student, a better member of the school community, and a better human being as well. Throughout the tirade she would stop and ask me to affirm what she said, and I would do my best to look thoroughly bored.<BR>
<BR>
I told her I didn't want to do any.<BR>
<BR>
'Why?' she kept asking me. The other girls in the class were palpably uncomfortable. I was sitting near the door, and bundled up my things and walked out. Usually in such a situation another girl would get up and totter after you to offer comfort, but no one in the room was my friend or even liked me particularly much. I felt very free walking away, and I didn't go back to that particular class for the rest of the term (it was during assembly time, some kind of study skills and support type thing), and went and sung hymns with the Year Sevens in the chapel instead, which was far more enjoyable.<BR>
<BR>
This confrontation had been brought on by these forms we had to fill in, the activity for the second half of the lesson. The first part, which is the relevant part to the ideas of silence and sound involved Mrs Kaye making us lie on the floor, which smelled of lunchboxes, pencil shavings and dirty feet. We lay flat on our backs and relaxed, piece by piece, each part of our bodies. She gradually instructed which parts to relax, as if we had no idea how our body parts connected up. Once we had the whole thing relaxed, or had pretended to, she told us to concentrate very hard on the furthest away sound that we could hear.<BR>
<BR>
This is the moment in my life when I started to think more about listening than I ever had before, and had the school activities section of the lesson occurred first I would never had experienced this awakening. <BR>
<BR>
It upset me that I could not tear apart the general sound of the school around me into anything more than ten distinct noises. I have a very clear memory of how I listed them in my head: the hum of the fluorescent lights; Mrs Kaye's voice droning about 'letting yourself go'; the birds outside; the hum of a lawnmower (my school had a lot of lawns, none of which you were allowed to walk or sit on); voices from other classrooms; and the occasional sound of cars starting up and driving away. <BR>
<BR>
From that moment I listened to everything far more closely, and often made lists of all the noises that I could separate at a certain time. As I pull earplugs out of my ears all the sound sharpens and rushes back in, and I feel woken up, like I've jumped into cold water, nerves tingling and senses heightened. Unfortunately living near a main road most of the noise that is present is the varied sounds of cars, buses, motorbikes, trucks, squealing brakes, sirens and irate horn honking. Over that sometimes I can hear the conversations of people walking underneath the balcony. There are regulars - at three every afternoon a woman and her son, whose name I have ascertained is Declan, walk down the alleyway. Every time they do so she is yelling at him. Either she is particularly intolerant, or he is a real monster of a boy. I will be working at my desk and suddenly the general background noise will be cut through with the nasal yell 'Declan! Come back here! Stop! Don't go any further!'<BR>
<BR>
I heartily recommend closing your eyes and trying to isolate all the sounds around you, especially in public places. Don't feel self-conscious&euro;no one will notice&euro;they're too busy with themselves, carting around shopping bags, eating, thinking about all manner of wild, personal things.<BR>
<BR>
Mrs Kaye left a lasting impression on me after all, but it wasn't her exhortations to join the library club, or one of the other extra activities designed for people with few friends, social skills or athletic ability. She got me listening.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
3. Insomnia and Tenderness<BR>
<BR>
I am not a very good sleeper, and I often lie in bed for hours fighting a mental war between the sensible part of my thoughts that tells me to eliminate all worries and concrete plans and concepts and drift off into glorious slumber, and the part of my thoughts that is renegade, and will continue to churn with any idea that could potentially prevent me sleeping.<BR>
<BR>
Recently I was lying in bed, and had managed to shush the energetic mind voice, and was ready to abandon myself to complete relaxation, when it popped up again.<BR>
<BR>
'Your heartbeat is so loud, Vanessa. I can hear it like someone knocking at the window to get my attention. How much sound is your body responsible for, right now, in its resting state?'<BR>
<BR>
Little bugger. This thought was irresistible, and I could not leave it alone. I wondered how loud the sound of the heartbeats of everyone in the world would be, if you measured each one and added them together. I thought the same of the world's population breathing, and how loud that would be, all added together. Both would be a huge roar, much louder than standing near an aeroplane taking off.<BR>
<BR>
I thought too about when you rest your head on someone's stomach, and the various internal growls that eerily travel through their skin and into your ear. It's really quite noisy in there, it growls and gurgles and reminds me of the noises ships make when they tip and roll back and forth at anchor. There is so much external noise that it is pleasant to concentrate on the sounds that your body or someone else's makes (preferably a person you are in love with, their sleeping breathing is beautiful, whilst the sleeping breathing of the old guy next to you on a long distance train journey is a terrible repulsing thing) joints and bones cracking, intestines growling, sneezing, chewing, breathing, footsteps, tapping fingers&euro;a long list of sounds made by the human body&euro;let alone speech, let alone all the things you can reach out for and make noise with.<BR>
<BR>
-<BR>
<BR>
I don't think I've been anywhere that's truly silent. It must be impossible unless you are deaf, no matter where you are there is always the thud of your heart valves opening and closing. For some, I suppose, silence is merely the absence of talking, it is so easy to accept the noise of the world that often when I'm duped into thinking how quiet it is I force myself to listen to my surroundings, and realise there is so much noise in the world, all spread out in innumerable layers, impossible to pick apart.<BR>
