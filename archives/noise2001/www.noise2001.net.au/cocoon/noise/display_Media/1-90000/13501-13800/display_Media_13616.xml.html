I wrote this after I had talked to a girl online who has really suffered so much evil at the hands of others. These innocents who think there is something wrong with them, and are so helpless that they start cutting into themselves, and have the lowest opinions of themselves that I've ever seen. It's so sad. I want people like that to realise that they are not alone, and that they still are precious. <BR>

<B>PURE ANGEL</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pure Angel<BR>
<BR>
She is an angel sent from Heaven,<BR>
Her voice is soft and soothing,<BR>
She reaches out to others in all that she does.<BR>
Her heart is full of love...<BR>
And her soul is pure...<BR>
<BR>
On her back are the wings of freedom,<BR>
open and outstretched, <BR>
ready to soar,<BR>
waiting for the moment when she can fly back home.<BR>
<BR>
Her face glows amidst the gloom,<BR>
Her halo all can see,<BR>
some will see her and find hope,<BR>
others are filled with hatred.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Who is she to have such joy?<BR>
Why should her clothes be white as snow?<BR>
Why should she be any different from us?&quot;<BR>
And they plot against her.<BR>
<BR>
And they lie about this pure angel...<BR>
and they slander her name...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
She is an angel amongst demons,<BR>
Her voice is sad and haunting,<BR>
She reaches out to others in all that she does.<BR>
Her heart is full of love and pain...<BR>
Still her soul is pure...<BR>
<BR>
On her back are the wings of freedom,<BR>
curled around her,<BR>
holding to herself,<BR>
waiting for the moment when she can leave this place.<BR>
<BR>
Her face is teary amongst the gloom,<BR>
Her halo all can see,<BR>
some see her and find hope,<BR>
others smite her with their hatred.<BR>
<BR>
They grab at her, to take her joy.<BR>
They taint her white robes with their filth.<BR>
They try to make her just like them.<BR>
And they rip into her.<BR>
<BR>
And they crush this pure angel...<BR>
and they laugh at her state...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
She is an angel in the corner,<BR>
Her voice is raw and crying,<BR>
Still she reaches out for others, it is all she can do.<BR>
Her heart is full of pain...<BR>
but still her soul is pure...<BR>
<BR>
On her back are the wings of freedom,<BR>
shredded and broken,<BR>
limp and without feeling,<BR>
begging for the moment when all of this can end.<BR>
<BR>
Her face is weary amidst the gloom,<BR>
Her halo all have seen,<BR>
Will no-one see her and offer hope?<BR>
Will all just laugh and walk on by?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What did I do to lose my joy?<BR>
I didn't ask for clothes as white as snow.<BR>
Why do I have to be so different from them?<BR>
Oh God, why do you do this to me?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And the Father weeps with His angel,<BR>
And says to her these words...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You are still my angel, my dearest, my child,<BR>
Keep listening to My voice,<BR>
Keep reaching out to others in all that you do.<BR>
My heart is full of love. And my heart is yours.<BR>
Your soul is pure.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I will heal your broken wings,<BR>
and teach you how to fly again,<BR>
I take pride in watching you soar,<BR>
And I am waiting for the time when I can carry you Home...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hold your head high amidst the gloom,<BR>
Everyone should see your glowing halo,<BR>
Some will see you and find hope,<BR>
and yes, some will look on you with scorn.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But the joy I give you, no-one can take away,<BR>
I gave you garments as white as snow,<BR>
for I want you to be different from them,<BR>
because you are precious in my eyes and I love you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So keep going. Learn from me and my way,<BR>
Take heart... and soar on my wings.&quot;<BR>
