A rant on self identity, self hate and denial.<BR>
<BR>
--<BR>
<BR>
Self hate - denial - whatever... fat (I'm feeling bloated) white rambling Chinko thoughts.<BR>
<BR>
I'll be the first to admit calling myself a &quot;Chinko&quot; is strange for me- and before anyone goes off I'm using the term because its so stupid - I'll joke around and use the word Chinko but you won't get me saying GOOK or Slanty-Eyed Nip - those words take things too far - they're violent and make me scowl and look down at the floor - but like I said, here I am claiming to be all multicultural and shit and its not like I've ever even called myself &quot;Australian-Malaysian&quot; or &quot;Malaysian-Australian&quot; anyway, not like I'm even fighting a background to begin with. I'm not the typical Asian image you'd see on TV - on the commercial soapies - you know those characters who appear for a couple of weeks - and have to leave town for some reason - god forbid having someone yellow on the TV for too long!  But yeah I'm not like that - I'm not the girl trying to go out with a white boy against her father's wishes. I'm not being forced to study too hard by my parents to become a doctor - right now I'm unemployed a student doing honours in film and TV - a thesis on lesbian film, I don't need a boyfriend - I'm happy with friends and casual sex.  <BR>
<BR>
As I was saying I don't know that much about my background - my mother who has always insisted, (for as long as I can remember) &quot;I honestly don't know why I married your father&quot; married dad in Hong Kong in 1979 - they met while she was on holiday in Malaysia. My father is from a Chinese Father and a Thai Mother - although that could be wrong - I always forget to get dad to clarify that - but &quot;my dad was born in Malaysia&quot; and that is what I say - that is my little phrase when I meet new people and they give me one of those looks - and say &quot;So where are you from?&quot;- this pisses me off to no end - like it matters where I'm fucking from - I always promptly answer &quot;Brisbane&quot; - they then give me another look - and say &quot;No I mean where were you born?&quot; and when I say &quot;Sydney&quot; they finally ask - &quot;where are your parents from&quot; and then I use my pre-recorded message, my line &quot;My Dad's from Malaysia&quot; - using my 'don't ask me any more f-ing questions tone' and then they nod - like it explains everything - like its going to give them the whereabouts to Osama Bin Laden or something. This comes all after they've tried saying my name wrong 12 different ways - how fucking hard is it to say &quot;Li-Kim&quot;? (pronounced Lee - Kim&quot;). I tell ya I've had some great efforts over the years - &quot;Lie&quot;, &quot;Lie-Kum&quot; &quot;Lickem&quot; - some old person even tried to call me &quot;Kimberly&quot; that was after she had called me &quot;Kim Lee&quot; for two days. Oh and by the way don't try and shorten it to just &quot;Lee&quot; or just &quot;Kim&quot; - I won't have that either. Did I mention I'm NOT a nice friendly girl and I can be quite HOSTILE - or just plain rude as my mother puts it?! <BR>
<BR>
But lets get back on track, basically I don't know shit about Dad and his background - its my own fault I know - I don't know another language other than English - actually I know a bit of Hokkien, the irony is I can actually speak more Italian which I learnt in high school, but anyway in Hokkien I can count to 13 - just - I can say, &quot;vagina, penis, squat, wash your bum, finished, Singlet, are you hungry? How are you? And happy New Year!&quot; And I can also say some saying (an ancient Malaysian proverb perhaps?) which roughly equates to &quot;the dog follows the fart&quot; - thanks dad for teaching me that one.  ;)<BR>
<BR>
What are we here for? What am I saying? - oh yeah - this is meant to be about love and hate - self hate perhaps? - which isn't really true because I don't hate myself - I deny myself more than anything - a part of myself that is. For some reason (for me anyway) it seems easier to figure out one's sexuality than one's race - even though you know when you look in the mirror your race - you can't look in the mirror and tell if your gay or not - perhaps you can I don't know. What I am trying to say is that although sexual identity is perhaps one of the more illusive concepts that is always fluid and which will change over time - it seems easier to grasp than figuring out which way you should look or how you should feel when someone calls you a Gook in the street. Sorry for the sexuality rant - my thesis is obviously catching up with me.<BR>
<BR>
Whats that line? Its from a movie - I assume it is - its said by some Asian prostitute &quot;sucky sucky two dollar? I love you long time&quot;. It's the line guys - no make that 'men' (and I'll use the term loosely) say when they are making jokes about Asian women - guys laugh at this - I personally have never found it funny, more than anything it gets me confused - which way do I look? Do I laugh along at the pointless joke? Wait for them to realise 'there is an &quot;Asian&quot; in the room' and for them to apologise - this has never happened by the way. Who am I meant to defend myself as an Australian or myself as part Malaysian - a side of me which is pretty weak. I begin to think &quot;is that what they think of me? Is that what they think when they see me walking down the street - when they see me do they think I'm 'ONE OF THEM'.  Which Asian stereotype do I belong to? I'm not pretty or glamorous so they probably think I'm the sweet, nice, obedient, submissive studious type studying business or marketing. Hang on by me even thinking about such stereotypes, does that make me racist? No doubt I probably am in some respects I think it would be hard not to be in today's society - blame society I say! No I won't. It's cool - I'm cool, I've had my rant for the day. Goodbye.<BR>
