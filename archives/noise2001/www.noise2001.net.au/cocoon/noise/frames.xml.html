<FONT color="RED">Hip Hop Up Top</FONT><BR>
As of ooh... three days ago, young MCs up in the Northern Territory have been taking part in rap workshops with a gaggle of professional hip hop artists and Triple J music producers. A crew from Don Dale Detention Centre has already come up with some lines, which form the basis of a track on juvenile justice. You too can get involved: submit a rhyme or two online at <A href="http://triplej.abc.net.au/noise/hiphopuptop" target="new">triplej.abc.net.au</A>. When enough lines have been collected, the song will be recorded and played on Triple J.<BR>
