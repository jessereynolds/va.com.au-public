For me, comics have become a very central part of who I am.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Why did you start drawing comics?</B><BR>
I can't remember, I was about 17, I'd always been into comics and making things - I started off drawing sketches during class, sometimes writing stupid little stories with them - then some of those sketches got incorporated into a longer narrative. The first comic I ever did was Cygani - sci-fi/stoner retard humour.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Why the switch from sci-fi to autobio? </B><BR>
Part of the reason I started drawing sci-fi stuff was because I couldn't draw people. I made things up so no one could say, &quot;that's not how you draw that&quot;. Science fiction and science have always played a big part in my life - both my parents are scientists and I did a pure maths/science stream at high school. <BR>
<BR>
As I slowly taught myself how to draw and became more confident of my personal perspective, I started producing more autobiographical style stories. However, I wouldn't actually classify myself as an autobiographical comic book artist.  The stories that I draw are based on my version of the world and are influenced by the life I lead. Sometimes real events get dragged straight in because I couldn't have written it any better but mostly I like to remove the story a degree or two away from myself.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How do you feel about autobio comics? </B><BR>
Some of the most moving and touching comics I have ever read have been autobio. I admire the artists of those comics for being able to let the reader into some of the most personal, embarrassing and tragic moments of their life. I think this admiration comes from knowing that for myself, I couldn't share such personal information with an unknown reader.<BR>
<BR>
<B>On a personal level, what do you think you get out of drawing comics? </B><BR>
For me comics has become a very central part of who I am, I spend most of my productive time involved in some part of the comic creating process - sketching, inking, writing then cleaning up and laying out on the computer. I taught myself to draw so I get a great deal of satisfaction from being able to see my style and technique mature. Drawing comics is something that I have never HAD to do for anyone - the only reason I keep making them is because I want to. I like waking up every day and kicking myself in the arse to get up and keep going - killing procrastination - never accepting excuses from myself.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you set out to communicate morals or messages in your comics? </B><BR>
With my comics I'm just trying to provide another point of view, another way of looking at things that we take for granted. In my next comic (which my sister Martina wrote) an idea from theoretical physics is seamlessly woven into an autobiographical style fictional story. With my science background I try breaking down conceptual walls of understanding particularly when it comes to mathematics and physics. In terms of morals and messages - anyone who creates a comic or zine can be seen to be projecting the morals and messages that they lead there own lives by to a much larger audience - even if it is a purely aesthetic message or preference.<BR>
<BR>
<B>What advice would you give to someone just starting out? </B><BR>
Stay true to yourself.<BR>
