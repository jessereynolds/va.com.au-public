I think in the end I am envious of others' courage to tell their stories however fantastic or banal.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How do you feel about autobio comics?</B><BR>
<BR>
I'm fascinated by them, yet always sceptical about the creator's intentions. Are they saying &quot;here, this is a great story&quot; or &quot;I am the only interesting thing in life&quot;? For no apparent reason I delve into autobio comics expecting them to be self-absorbed drivel, but are usually pleasantly surprised. I guess this is more of a comment on my outlook than on the comics. <BR>
<BR>
<B>How many issues of &quot;Geek Overload&quot; have you done?</B><BR>
<BR>
Five actual Geeks exist as half-arsed attempts due to a mixture of laziness, good food, and dribbling on the bed. Millions more in my head are flushed like unfertilised eggs by talking too much crap, depressive paralysis, or distracting elation. I don't expect to do another Geek; it belongs with my Melbourne life. Canberra has me making cd-roms and writing music. Music is where I get all the self-indulgent rubbish out. Sorry to those ears who know.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Why did you make the leap between just drawing comics and actually putting a comic out?</B><BR>
<BR>
Countless scraps of scribbled-on paper soothe fresh-produce boxes in my workroom like empty-nesters with a boarder. It wasn't until a year after Mandy Ord asked me to do a comic for a compilation called Sticky Date that I bought a sketchbook. The first Geek came from months of insomnia having moved to a new city with an almost out of control drinking problem. I never intended to do another. It was letters from people I didn't know asking me questions like they were interested that created the others. I still doodle.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Were you inspired by particular people and/or comics?</B><BR>
<BR>
Inspiration has always come from whatever makes me cry: a song, a painting, a story, the supermarket. Whether that's out of joy, anguish, laughter, stupidity, whatever. My interest in comics stemmed from a Christmas present from my mother yonks ago. She'd bought me a Fantastic Four special edition that was half my size. I didn't much care for the content, as it was full of blokes except for Invisible Girl who you hardly got to see. However there was this one bit where (I can't remember his alias) was changing back into The Thing and it made him cry. I guess we all turn into people we never thought we'd become every now and then, especially at times when we want to remain ourselves.<BR>
<BR>
<B>On a personal level, what do you think you get out of drawing comics?</B><BR>
<BR>
It used to be the sense of belonging that I loved the most. There were monthly comic meetings that introduced me to my favourite people. Perhaps that's why the comics have practically stopped, because the people have gone. Oh and the studying full-time may be partially responsible&amp;sum;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Have you ever received fan mail? </B><BR>
<BR>
Yeah. It was either hysterical babbling nonsense and a comic swap, or an eloquent, heartbreaking letter. I loved both - it always made me cry. I guess because someone actually bothered. Kindness is simple and rare.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Have you ever written fan mail to another comic artist?</B><BR>
<BR>
Possibly. I can't remember. I've probably written to Kieran Mangan and Mandy Ord because they're both extraordinarily ace. I know I've wanted to write to Michael Leunig, but what can you say to him about his raw melancholy besides how it makes it difficult to breathe? <BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you set out to communicate morals or messages in your comics? </B><BR>
<BR>
No.<BR>
<BR>
<B>What advice would you give to someone just starting out?</B><BR>
<BR>
Apparently I give bad advice, so all I have to say is: do what makes you feel content, terrified, happy, and crazy. If you want to do it, you'll do it.<BR>
