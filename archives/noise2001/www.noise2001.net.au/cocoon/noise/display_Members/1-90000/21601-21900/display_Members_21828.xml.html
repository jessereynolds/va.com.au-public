I'm not quite sure when it started, as I'd been doodling and compiling things for many years. <BR>
<BR>
The first time I really noticed myself doing comics was when I was travelling overseas for a couple of years. I was on the road alone for most of the time, so my journal became my best mate, my confidante and a forum for exploring what I was doing, seeing and thinking.<BR>
<BR>
Life in general inspires me to draw - observing people and the great machinations of life. I'm very passionate about politics (in a social as well as a governmental sense) so issues of social justice and societal complexity are what really get my fingers inky.<BR>
<BR>
My work has appeared in a wide range of publications, including The Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian, The Age, The Bulletin, Strewth and The Chaser. I've also illustrated books, designed cards and t-shirts. On top of all that, I've also worked extensively for community organisations and love the challenge of presenting social issues in comic form. In terms of other creative stuff, I write a fair bit of satirical stuff. I contribute to The Chaser and also have a monthly column on the Mambo website called &quot;The Angriest Girl in the World&quot;, which is great fun because I basically get to bitch about whatever I want!<BR>
<BR>
I'm a firm believer in creativity in all aspects of life - in your relationships with people, in your workplace, in your home. In addition to cartooning, I also work occasionally producing radio at the ABC and have a part time job in a women's refuge, which gave me the inspiration to do this particular comic. I've been uplifted, informed and sometimes deeply disturbed by things I encounter at the refuge and believe the issue of domestic violence is a most important (and difficult) one to address. <BR>
<BR>
As far as a big message goes, I'd have to say the underlying theme to my work is my belief that things are never just as they seem. There are always things going on beneath the surface and it's important to be aware of them. Complacency is death! For this reason, I love the art of cartooning and comic book making. The art of metaphor can convey a message that mere words cannot.<BR>
<BR>
Comics most definitely can change the world. They are such a human form of expression. Whether simple and personal or grandstanding and complex, there's a passion behind them that you don't often find in other mediums. Again, I'd like to hail the fine art of metaphor -  I think it engages the reader in a way that text alone does not - the reader must interpret and make the connection her/himself and that can form the most magical bond.<BR>
<BR>
The hardest thing about drawing comics to me is to keep them as subtle but strong as possible. When I think up a comic, I immediately eliminate all the most direct interpretations of a theme. I prefer to capture the issue through characters and more oblique approaches to the main themes.<BR>
<BR>
The best thing about drawing comics is finding just the right metaphor, just the right characters  then losing yourself in the actual act of illustration. Joy!<BR>
