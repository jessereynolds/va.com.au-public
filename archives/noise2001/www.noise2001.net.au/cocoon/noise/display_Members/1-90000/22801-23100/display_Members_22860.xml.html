My name is Rye Barry, I'm 21. I live in Brisbane. Do art at Uni. I'm doing my Honours in Fine Arts at QCA Griffith Uni Brisbane. This where I got interested in video, not the normal type, but the backyard late night variety. <BR>
<BR>
I started using video in my art work, as an installation tool. Then got hooked and now it's pretty much all i use. After experimenting a bit i started to move into other areas. (video mixing) was the first thing that i really decided that i wanted to learn, which is fun, but i still havn't got the guts to do any live stuff yet. This influenced my art practise and now i'm using more interactive video. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Why do you do what you do?</B><BR>
I don't know the art is just natural to me, and everything else is fun.  <BR>
 <BR>
<B>How do you do it?</B><BR>
I mostly started using Premiere which taught me editing, with a little more freedom for manipulation. But my ambitions soon outgrow my ability. On work i did took me about 100 hours of cut and paste becuase i didn't know a better way (yet to find out) Recently I got a friend to write me a little piece of software, which is exellent, and that will be showcased in my next work. I try not to let the computer take over the aesthetics of my work, i want to use the tools but no the gimmicks. I'm not really that good at computer stuff, i'm just persistent. <BR>
 <BR>
<B>What do you like/ dislike about your work?</B><BR>
Everything I do at the moment makes me learn something new, but i can't learn fast enought to do what i want to.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>What/ who are you influences?</B><BR>
There are a list of video artists. Gary Hill would have to be one, saw one of his works in the last <B>Sydney Biennale</B>. But my friends and people I've met around are the most influecial because you can relate, everyone has a different idea and a different way, so you learn heaps just from talking to people.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Where can people read your work/ where is it available?</B><BR>
I've got a show on at the IMA it's there till 11th of June, and another show at Pine Rivers Regional Gallery opens the 11th of July. But if you don't see any of these you have to check out vidi-ator on the 12th of July <BR>
 <BR>
<B>What excites you?</B><BR>
Watching things grow <BR>
<BR>
<B>What annoys you?</B><BR>
Not having enough time. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What is the most exciting thing you have done?</B> <BR>
Probably something that I don't want strangers to know! <BR>
<BR>
<B>What was the last thing to make you laugh out loud?</B><BR>
Wrestling with me flat mates <BR>
<BR>
<B>What was the last movie you've seen?</B> <BR>
<I>Shock Treatment</I> - I bought it for a dollar at an op-shop, it's the sequel to <I>Rocky Horror</I>.<BR>
<BR>
<B>What's your Favourite artform and why?</B><BR>
I can't say I have a favorite if I think it's good then you've got me. <BR>
<BR>
<B>If you had fifteen minutes of fame what would you like to be famous for?</B><BR>
I've never really wanted to be famous - just rich. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What's your favourite time of day?</B><BR>
The Morning. You can either sleep in and not worry about it, or get up and there's no pressure to do anything yet. <BR>
<BR>
<B>If you could go anywhere, where would you go and why?</B><BR>
I'd like to go to a desert to do some filming, something about the presence of abscence. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What book are you readng at the moment?</B><BR>
<I>Diverse Practices: A Critical Reader on British Video Art</I> (as you can see I'm doing a thesis at the moment) <BR>
<BR>
<B>And anything else you would like to divulge????</B><BR>
