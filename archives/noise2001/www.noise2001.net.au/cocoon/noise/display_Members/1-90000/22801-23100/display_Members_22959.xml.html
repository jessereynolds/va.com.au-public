<B>Q. Exactly what do you do?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> I write and self-publish novels to gain an independent understanding of the market out there, my market. I know the publishing industry is the way to go for professional kudos but I'm uncomfortable with their marketing agenda, specifically the stereotypical commercially driven genres - which I'm not discounting, I want to battle it out first and create my niche to crush their kitsch. Once I finished my Little Aussie Writer Battler Experiment I'll join the dark side - No, I'll be the dark side. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. Why do you do what you do?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> I went to my Senior 10 year re-union last week. Eric from Amsterdam says to me, &quot;So are you a cartoonist?&quot; and I said, &quot;No, why?&quot; and he said, &quot;Well when I sat next to you in class that's all you were doing - drawing.&quot; I believe what you're destined to do shines through when you're a teenager. I was always cartooning and writing stories, projecting my unstoppable imagination onto paper. Now I'm grown up if I don't contribute to the hostile world with my creative product (because that's what is has to be), what else can I possible do? PS. I failed school, but not the education.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. How do you do it?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> Work Hard All The Time. First job when I was in school was a storeman, then after school, labourer, tricked my way into office jobs, became a temp, drifted into pizza making and web-publishing, self-taught graphic-designer, aim for juicy contracts. Always working to pay for time off to write. Even when I'm blatantly on the rock'n'roll for a few months I'm working on my craft. Never be afraid to accept a job that's out of your league, how else can you advance yourself? Constant and diverse work keeps the mind active, but one must find the time and in a disciplined manner, write night and day, otherwise nothing gets done and then it's all cafe talk.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What do you like/ dislike about your work?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> I like that I can actually complete something and 'give the baby away'. The current novel I'm working on is 217,000 words, written and re-written over 10 years. I dislike that it takes sooooo long, but now I'm super proficient at identifying what's required and what's not. No more stuffing around with whimsical ideas that sound great but really, don't relate. <B>And Dislikes?</B> When I've finished something, I feel compelled to defend it but think, why? It's just a work of Fiction. As a story, does it work? Yes? No? Did you like it? I liked writing it, otherwise I wouldn't offer it to you.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What/ who are you influences?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> Long before the movie came out I read 'The Lord of the Rings'. I thought, wow, this guy writes this huge book you have to read all the way through to understand and fully enjoy the story, and gets away with it! I can do that too! Other writer's include Hemmingway, Ian Flemming (007 is the real me in a parallel universe), Milan Kundera, Joseph Heller (Catch-22), Patrick White, and a plethora of other writers that share the same fundamental - they are telling a story and it ain't about glorifying themselves. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. Where can people read your work/ where is it available?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> My <A href="http://www.simondrake.com" target="other">website</A> is my digital billboard for sample chapters, short stories, poetry, artwork, and links to online book  sellers that sell my paperbacks. I'm currently working out print-runs and distribution into the real bookstores; round the corner from <B>You</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What excites you?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> The unexplainable and unpredictable nature of Grrrls, taking on the unknown, and complete silence.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What annoys you?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> The mass of slime that's shoveled into our face and called Entertainment, Art and Things of Substance. Yes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and we have to cater to the masses, but if it's just drab, plain wallpaper, why call it something else? I think I just annoy myself with dissecting the non-truths out there. Mum, where's my Prozac.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What is the most exciting thing you have done?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> Accidentally, I rolled my ute on the curved exit off the Story Bridge heading into New Farm. True excitement grabs you from out of nowhere, slaps and kisses you around, then vanishes and doesn't leave a phone number.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What was the last thing to make you laugh out loud?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> Laughing at the absurdity that I shouldn't describe what perverted private thought made me last laugh out loud!<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What was the last movie you've seen?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> &quot;Australian Rules&quot; because I'm co-writing a feature script that's about an AFL betting scam. Unfortunately, the movie I saw was trying to be too much and kind of fell over but not without letting you know that some people have it real tough. Other than that, I watched an oldy, 'Five Easy Pieces', starring Jack Nicholson. It's a simple movie. I'm too sensitive to write reviews.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What's your Favourite artform and why?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> Writing because it's one on one communication, and mature paintings. I used to paint, and still do, but my brain is wired for writing and will be until I'm 60, then I'll paint again. It's the art of marrying technical skill and creative flair, not just the use of bright colours to depict some whacky scenario, but a humanist flair to bring to light something about ourselves via the subject. Take the Mona Lisa. Now that's Art. Translate that into writing. That's my job. Am I aiming too high? No. Just aiming to please.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. If you had fifteen minutes of fame what would you like to be famous for?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> I want to go in to space - heading for Jupiter or Saturn or Uranus - and die. Just like Burke and Wills, but I'd be 'Exploring Space' with some super smart German Astrophysics Babe. Yeah. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What's your favourite time of day?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> Dawn, just before the sun comes up. The bird's are the only ones singing. They know what's happening. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. If you could go anywhere, where would you go and why?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> I'd go anywhere because I've never left Australia! <BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What book are you reading at the moment?</B><BR>
<B>A.</B> I'm reading, for the 217th time, my manuscript 'Generous Enemies', with a red pen in my hand. It's my next novel and whilst proofing it I find it very hard to read someone elses work. When I'm not editing I'm constantly reading, I have to. The last fiction I read was &quot;Kissed the Girls and Made them Cry&quot;, some 1960's narration of some mid-life crisis Englishman set in the sixties working out if he should tie the knot, not as much as a stud as the cover made you think he would be. Non-fiction, &quot;The Art of the Novel&quot; by Milan Kundera. I've written one novel and two manuscripts yet a touch up on what to aim for by an independent European thinker can't hurt.<BR>
