<B>WHERE IT ALL STARTED</B><BR>
<BR>
I started drawing comics in 1996. I was involved in the creation of a magazine at uni, and someone suggested putting in comics - for some reason the idea appealed to me and I made up a character called Lima the witch. Lima had a pet cat who she flew around with at night. I gave up on Lima pretty quickly though, when I realised that I preferred writing about things that had actually happened to me.<BR>
<BR>
I had a crazy experience involving acid that I decided to draw a comic about, and from then on I started drawing comics about things that had happened to me. I got a few early comics published in Voiceworks magazine. Last year I went up to the Young Writers festival in Newcastle, and I decided to put together a small comic to take up there. That's how Nervous Energy was born - it's a comic about being nervous that comes with a floppy disk. On the disk is The Nerve Game - a computer game I made about stress that is in the same style as my comics.<BR>
<BR>
<B>THE CREATIVE PROCESS</B><BR>
<BR>
I love writing comics - I go through phases where I don't do any then I start and draw heaps. Because I'm pretty busy doing animation and installation art I often don't get time to draw comics. Then I find that for some reason (usually a deadline, or a project I'm involved in) I start again, and at first it's really hard. But as soon as I start drawing again I start getting lots of ideas and it gets a lot easier. I think my off-and-on output is also related to the fact that I draw very personal comics, and there are times in my life where I feel like telling stories about my life, and other times when I don't. To be able to write about personal stuff you need a certain amount of detachment, particularly with really full-on stuff. So sometimes I find I'm still too close to a topic to write about it.<BR>
<BR>
The hardest thing about drawing comics is the painful time when you ink the comic and you have to concentrate so hard so you don't make a mistake! Also trying to work out how to say something that's really hard to say. <BR>
<BR>
The best thing is being able to see your experiences in a whole new light; drawing comics with friends. A friend and I have regular comic nights where we'll draw comics together. It's much more fun to draw with someone else, and it motivates you. Also you can get feedback from each other.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SELF-PUBLISHING</B><BR>
<BR>
The other reason I love doing comics is because I enjoy making something concrete that people can keep, especially since I do a lot of work with digital mediums and installations, which are very temporary things. <BR>
<BR>
Putting together Nervous Energy is a very time consuming process. First I draw a rough copy in pencil, then I draw a good copy in pencil, then I ink it using a calligraphy pen and ink. Then I scan it into the computer, and colour it in on the computer. <BR>
<BR>
Then I arrange all the pages using a different computer program, after which I print a copy out then photocopy it. The cover I did in colour, and I printed out each cover on my printer . Then because I make the comic a non-standard size, I have to cut everything out using a stanley knife then put it together and staple the pages together, I always forget how much work it takes!<BR>
<BR>
<B>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</B><BR>
<BR>
In telling stories about stuff that has happened to me I hope people who read it can relate to parts of it. Sometimes the comics I write have a subtle message and people can choose to take it or leave it. <BR>
<BR>
Personal stories can change the world -  if you can relate to someone's experience it gives you a new view on things. Sometimes it's good to know you're not the only person in the world who feels a particular way, and if you read a comic where someone is going through an experience similar to one you've had it can help you understand your experience better. About a year ago my cat died, and I remember reading a comic by Roberta Gregory about her cat dying. Reading it made me really sad, but it kind of made me feel better at the same time.  I love the way comics can be so funny yet so sad at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
<B>YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DRAW! </B><BR>
<BR>
I used to be really down on myself because I felt like I couldn't draw in a realistic photo-like way. And occasionally I still get frustrated - when I was drawing my comic about paperboys I kept having to draw bicycles which I found really difficult because they're hard to draw. But now I like my child-like figures - I think the simplicity of my drawings is part of their appeal.<BR>
