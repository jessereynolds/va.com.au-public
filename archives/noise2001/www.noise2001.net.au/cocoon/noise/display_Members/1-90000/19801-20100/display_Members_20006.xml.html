I consider myself primarily a writer, involved in most facets. Though I consider journalism - primarily music style - my future.<BR>
<BR>
I co-produce and publish Kill the Cod zine, on-line and off, and having been doing so since December 1996.I have also produced my own fanzine, papillon, in October 2000, and am working on several others with different people.  I am also involved  in U-Turn Street Press - which is a new street press in Newcastle - submitting articles, reviews and interviews on a voluntary basis. I also occasionally free lance for the Newcastle University Magazine, Opus. I am currently doing voluntary work also helping out with the Newcastle Young Writers Festival, as well as organising fundraising activities for the Red Star Club, a new venue for young people being set up in Newcastle by Marcus Westbury. I have also been running an occasional pop-club night in Newcastle called *starshaped* with my friend and co-editor of Kill the Cod zine, the first of which ran in April this year. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Why do you do what you do?</B><BR>
I see my zine as a creative outlet and a way to be involved in things I appreciate. Also, as seeing my future as being in the music/media industry, I try to involve myself in events that will advance my experience, create new contacts, and look great on my resume! I like to keep myself busy and (hopefully) challenged.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How do you do it?</B><BR>
A lot of time on the computer, a lot of time socialising, a fair bit of time on the phone, and quite a lot of time sitting on the floor with glue on my hands and bits of cut up paper everywhere. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What do you like/dislike about your work?</B><BR>
I love interacting with people, socialising and meeting people that I admire. Time spent on the computer typing things up can get tedious, and attempting to get other people's arses into gear when you're relying on them for something can be trying, but at the moment, I love all the things I'm involved in and plan only to do bigger and greater things in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tell us about yourself - who are you?</B><BR>
How does anyone answer the question of who they are? I thought about this a lot before attempting this question. I'm bree Suzanne Roberts, always with a lower case b. I'm a writer and a big reader, and have been both these things ever since I was able to be. Writing and music are my passions, and that's why I plan to involve myself in both of them always, using promotions as the other side- my socialising. I love talking to people, and meeting new people. I love seeing how far I can push things, and just how much I can get away with; and I'm good at both of these things. I smoke too much, I drive too fast, I drink far too much, and I love butterflys, books, the smell of vanilla, and the colour purple. That's who I am, I guess. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What/who are your influences?</B><BR>
Dostoevsky, Scooby Doo, Kim Gordon, David Lynch, Anais Nin, Malboro Lights, train station sushi, baby doll by ysl, The Goodies, John Hughs, Jack Kerouac, drew barrymore, sally williamson, and The Young Ones. <BR>
<BR>
<B>How can people see more of your stuff?</B><BR>
Kill the Cod zine is sold in Sydney (Red Eye Records), Melbourne (Polyester Books), Brisbane (Rockinghorse), Newcastle (Cooks Hill Bookshop) and soon to be in Canberra. It is also available online through Electrocution Distrobution (as well as Papillion), and can be seen at http://www.geocities.com/killthecod . The first issue of U Turn Street Press should be available in Newcastle and the Central Coast within the next couple of months. The Cod's  moving to Sydney within the year, so I plan to be getting involved with many other things in Sydney when that occurs. <BR>
