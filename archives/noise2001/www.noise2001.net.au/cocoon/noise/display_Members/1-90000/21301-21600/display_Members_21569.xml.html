I think some people have issues with people who can't draw realistically doing comics.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WHO IS ALINE KOMINSKY-CRUMB? </B><BR>
<BR>
Aline Kominsky-Crumb is married to the famous Robert Crumb. After breaking away from Womin's Comix feeling the politics of the group restricted her, she became one of the editors of Twisted Sisters, a comic compilation of female comic artists. Later she became the editor of Weirdo, a fantastic comic compilation around in the early 80s. Many fans were disgusted with the change of editors, saying that Kominsky ruined Weirdo, and some even accused her of including too many women in issues! Kominsky revelled in the criticism, saying they were poor little fanboys who were just jealous because she was married to Robert Crumb and they weren't.<BR>
<BR>
Her comics are autobiographical, focussing mainly on her self perceived failures or embarrassing stories, but at the same time celebrating them and laughing at herself. She is self-obsessed, has a huge ego, and is extremely funny. She will often have asides which don't directly relate to the story, like: &quot;look at my tight bottom muscles - I've been working out&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Aline Kominsky was the first comic artist I discovered, and I have been hooked ever since. I am very influenced by her style, mainly her humour and self confession stuff. I love the way she draws - simply, but with criss crosses for the background, and big noses - and her stories can be painfully honest and painfully funny at the same time. <BR>
<BR>
<B>WHY &quot;RELAXBABY&quot;?</B><BR>
<BR>
I started doing my comic RelaxBaby, because of a horrible thing that happened to me, where I was in the most extreme pain (which I thought was period pain, but at the same time didn't think period pain could ever be THAT painful), and collapsed in the street having to eventually be taken away in an ambulance. I was told that I could have endometriosis, but they wouldn't know until I had an operation where they could look around inside me. It was a really upsetting time, because no-one seemed to be taking me seriously (most of all doctors), and no-one I knew had even heard of endometriosis.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WORDS OR PICTURES? </B><BR>
<BR>
The question &quot;what is more important, the words or the pictures?&quot; is an interesting one. Obviously comics are a visual medium, so the pictures are very important. At the same time, comics are so much more than just pretty pictures. <BR>
<BR>
Often part of the style of a comic is the way the narrative flows from panel to panel, what is being said, what is being thought in comparison to what is being said (ie thought bubbles), and then what is specifically NOT being said. This then relates to the pictures. The pictures also definitely create a sense of narrative. For example there is a very different feel between Julie Doucet's normal drawing style, to the stories she has done using gauche (is that what you call it?). So I guess they're just as important as each other. <BR>
I think some people have issues with people who can't draw realistically doing comics. For me this is definitely not an issue, and comics that I find most boring are ones where the artist is obviously extremely talented visually, but has nothing to say. Obviously it comes down to an aesthetic choice, but I love pictures that look messy and out of proportion. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ADVICE TO OTHERS? </B><BR>
<BR>
I guess the advice I would give female comic artists starting out is to just do it, don't panic. If your first story doesn't work out it doesn't matter, you don't have to show anyone (except remember you are always the harshest judge). <BR>
<BR>
I found I gained the confidence to print myself by showing friends first. At first I did things in pencil and showed people, and if they didn't understand a section I could always rub it out and make it clearer. There are little things to keep in mind like people usually read from left to right, but you learn that from reading other comics. <BR>
<BR>
Check out as much as you can, so you can see different styles and ways of telling stories. I have converted lots of friends to comic book reading, just because they didn't know what was out there, so talk it up!<BR>
