The photograph has stood the test of time since the advent of the motion picture, long after many expected it to go the way of the horse and cart. A cinematographer can capture hours of real-time action with peripheral extras like sound and now audience interaction, yet a stills cameraperson only has a split second to communicate her/his message.&nbsp;

One guesses that the reason for its longevity is because we still crave imaginative free-reign over our art, creating an entire narrative from one single idea, or just spontaneously digging what we see.<BR>
<BR>
And giving the young people of Australia free reign over their imagination was exactly what was asked for when a <B>noisy</B> call went out for submissions to <I>Black+White</I>, the Oz magazine famous for its world-class photography and an uncanny ability to convince famous people to bare their bits in the name of art... <BR>
<BR>
From books of quotes and self-portraits to rundown railways and ballet shoes, the subject matter varied like the seasons thanks to the project's only guideline - to capture your life and world.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What struck us was how accurately the images reflected contemporary tastes and trends,&quot; comments Karen-Jane Eyre, <I>Black+White</I> Editor. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The works displayed a remarkably mature intent and were of a very high technical standard. Additionally, there were a significant number of strong entries from female photographers, which is a positive sign of things to come. For our final selection we chose some images for their pop sensibility, some for their originality and others for their sheer artistry.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Most applicants are aspiring amateurs and students, like Melbourne creative writing undergraduate <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/21601-21900/display_Members_21630.xml" target="other">Emily Hart</A>. &quot;It's always been a dream of mine to express myself,&quot; says Emily. &quot;I must say, I put a lot more effort into photography than my writing.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Emily's &quot;The Dancer&quot; can be seen alongside 23-year-old photography student <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/21601-21900/display_Members_21604.xml" target="other">Cory White</A>'s &quot;In The Dark&quot;, a gorgeously evocative and considered work from a person who has just finished a degree in criminology and loitered in darkrooms since the age of 12.<BR>
<BR>
Tracey Grimson, <B>noise</B> Print Producer, comments further on the depth of talent, not just in the <I>Black+White</I> call out, but across the festival. &quot;We've found literally thousands of young people through <B>noise</B> who are producing high quality creative works and who have interesting stories to tell, yet who aren't yet culturally or professionally recognised.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sydney film student <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/21601-21900/display_Members_21606.xml" target="other">Chris Coucouvinis</A> also has his &quot;Fold&quot; and &quot;Soar&quot; works on display in the supplement, a guy who compounds his visual creativity with heartily honest words. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think a lot, sometimes too much and over analyse everything,&quot; Chris mentions in his <B>noise</B> artist profile. &quot;I'm not the guy behind the guy behind the guy, I'm probably the guy who just dropped his change all over the floor across the room... I like to observe people. I think we are the strangest creatures on this planet, but I like being part of that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Chris can rest assured people <I>will</I> be observing him and enjoying this strange planet this October, as <I>Black+White</I>'s <B>noise</B> supplement, full of zesty surprises, appears on newsstands.<BR>
