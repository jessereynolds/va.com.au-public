&quot;Community radio means the world to me,&quot; Adelaide's 5UV radio producer Hermione Gilchrist says, &quot;it's the only place where a new broadcaster can learn the ropes without hanging up on their personality, where music isn't thrashed, and current affairs take more than the dominant perspective&quot;&nbsp;

We put out the call earlier in the year for young Orssies to send in their ideas to produce either:<BR>
1. A music program with funds from the Australian Music Radio Airplay Project (AMRAP) / <B>noise</B> initiative - which could be a new music program series, a live music recording, profiles of young artists or a live music program in October. <BR>
OR <BR>
2. If they were in Queensland - a radio program or piece with funds from the Arts Queensland / <B>noise</B> initiative - that profiled the creative work of young Queenslanders.<BR>
<BR>
As was the case with every other noise project, the call out brought forth a staggering amount of quality submissions from stations and talented individuals like <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/21301-21600/display_Members_21301.xml" target="other">Hermione Gilchrist</A>, producing musical and audio works from thrash punk to doco-making, post rock to classical and many places in between.<BR>
<BR>
We had Steven Ellis from 4AAA FM in QLD who went into detention centres and recorded the stories and music of young indigenous people, while <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/20101-20400/display_Members_20134.xml" target="other">Tom Phillipson</A> from Sydney's 2SER FM toured around the country recording the first ever national electronic music tour in regional areas. Then there's <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/21001-21300/display_Members_21284.xml" target="other">Indigo Wood</A>, the 18-year-old audiophile from the small NSW town of Bega who has been involved in radio since the age of 15, gives us &quot;South Coast Sounds&quot;, a program that profiles musicians of his local area on 2BAR FM.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Community radio can cop a lot of flack for low production values and a 'song-song-back announce' format,&quot; comments one of <B>noise</B>'s community radio producers Jacinta Walpole, &quot;but its been pretty amazing to see what just a little bit of cash can do for a young radiohead - from helping to cover production costs to even paying artists to record live to air. The AMRAP, Arts QLD and <B>noise</B> projects have funded some great community radio shows.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Community radio stations are featured from all over the country - from Queensland to the Victorian Central Highlands, to the NT, SA - not just the bigger capital city stations but small local regional stations, broadcasting their unique local sound across the region - nationally via CBAA satellite and on the NIRS<BR>
(National Indigenous Radio Service). <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a timely and exciting lesson in the passion of volunteer community broadcasters,&quot; adds <B>noise</B> online producer Lisa Greenaway enthusiastically, &quot;in an increasingly bland commercial radio world. All of the program makers share a real excitement about the music they're featuring. You get the feeling they're all up front at the gigs, even in some cases in between sets at their own gig somewhere else in town...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Also on the community radio airwaves throughout October, tune in for new Australian music by young musos who are, you guessed it, all under 25. AMRAP and <B>noise</B> have put together a killer compilation CD of<BR>
music that was submitted to the noise music project - called 'radio noise'. The CD is now in the record libraries of each and every community station in the country, so expect to hear new tracks from Bungalow, Lisa Couper, Vanessa Morfea, Tom Phillipson, Native Ryme and many more. <BR>
<BR>
Meagan Loader, the <B>noise</B> radio producer says, &quot;Do yourself a favour and tune into your local community station all this month.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So there, you've been told. Check out what's going on in your local area and who's doing what by keeping glued to <B>noise.net.au</B> throughout October.<BR>
