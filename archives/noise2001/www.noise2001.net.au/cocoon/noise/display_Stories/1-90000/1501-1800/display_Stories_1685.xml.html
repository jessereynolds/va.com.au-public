Our exclusive <B>noise</B> content and feature supplements show off the wares of Australia's hottest young creatives as we inject the country's best publications with the flavour of <B>noise</B> in October.&nbsp;

In a chance for photographers, fashion designers, writers, poets, musicians, artists, industrial designers and all other talented under twenty-fivers to have their work professionally published and presented, <B>noise</B>'s print projects have been an invaluable outlet to an abundance of untapped genius.<BR>
<BR>
So where can you find these <B>noise</B> print treasures?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Rolling Stone</I> magazine features a rockin' 32 page supplement profiling the noisiest girls in Australian music, in conjunction with support from the Office of Status of Women (OSW); the <I>Anthology</I> and <I>Snapshot</I> exclusive <B>noise</B> books display huge amounts of works by under-25 people; while <I>TV Hits</I> mag presents selections of creative writing, drawing, photography, song lyrics and poetry. <BR>
<BR>
A special edition of <I>24 Hours</I> magazine asked under-25s to get creative in the fields of music, performing and visual arts; <I>Voiceworks</I> mag focuses on non-fiction writing; and some of our brilliant young fashion and accessory designers had their concepts realised in <I>Australian Style</I> magazine. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;From a personal perspective, it's a great opportunity for me to work on a wide range of publications in a short period of time,&quot; <B>noise</B> Print Producer Tracey Grimson says. &quot;But beyond that, and so much more importantly, it's opened my eyes to the amazing breeding ground of Australian talent that exists in the under-25 age group.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Those flicking through <I>Monument</I> magazine in October will find the works of leading young designers and industrial designers, and readers of <I>Black+White</I> will see photography pieces by aspiring amateurs and students, like Melbourne creative writing undergraduate Emily Hart. &quot;It's always been a dream of mine to express myself,&quot; says Hart. &quot;I must say, I put a lot more effort into photography than my writing.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've found literally thousands of young people through <B>noise</B> who are producing high quality creative works and who have interesting stories to tell, yet who aren't yet culturally or professionally recognised,&quot; Grimson adds.<BR>
<BR>
Other publications include <I>Chick</I> Magazine - an open-ended creative works showcase; <I>HQ</I> magazine - where entrants were encouraged to go nuts with the word &quot;noise&quot; to produce writing, art and more; and music/culture mag <I>Juice</I> - who put out the call for absolutely anything with a creative bent, from graffiti and scribble to lyrics and poetry.<BR>
<BR>
All of these fine publications are on sale in stores and newsagencies now and throughout October. But click through to the below links to find out how to get hold of a copy of the exclusive <B>noise</B> releases - <I>Anthology</I>, <I>Snapshot</I>, our superb comic <I>How Comics Can Change The World</I>, and to find out more about the projects, artists and their wide world of works. <BR>
