<B>THE FRESH FLAVOUR OF JUICE</B>&nbsp;

Of all <B>noise</B> projects, there's one in particular that opened the creative flood gates the widest - JUICE magazine - seeking arty works in whatever style or format the punters wanted, as long as it would fit in on the page of a magazine.&nbsp;

&quot;What came back,&quot; enthuses <B>noise</B> Print Editor Tracey Grimson, &quot;was an amazing array of everything from graffiti art to short story writing, and every point in between.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
These many points Tracey refer to are, in many ways, indicative of the entire ethos behind <B>noise</B>, ie: writing, drawing, animating, photographing, filming, theorising, rhyming, recording, singing, painting, designing, stitching and protesting. Creating.<BR>
<BR>
Sydney's <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/21001-21300/display_Members_21013.xml" target="other">Kaliopi Poppy Diamantis</A> prepared an entire 'letters to the editor' section for JUICE that involved imaginary questions and answers from the public to <B>noise</B>, and then there's <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/20701-21000/display_Members_20970.xml" target="other">Teresa Leung</A> from Narwee, NSW, who has pursued and perfected the fickle art of typography.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Putting the artists of <B>noise</B> inside the pages of JUICE seemed to us like a really logical move,&quot; says JUICE acting editor Stuart Hitchings.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Juice was involved with the <I>LOUD</I> festival in 1998 and we were really happy with the outcome of that,&quot; Hitchings continues, &quot;so giving the young creative voices of Australia a platform again, this time in 2001, was something we were keen to do. The quality of work submitted to the JUICE project was really inspiring.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As part of this supplement, a number of ESKY project submissions were included [after the ESKY magazine ceased to exist during our project call-out period], giving the JUICE edition an extra abundance of cutting-edge, DIY works. Hence, one of the most immediate things that jumps into perspective when perusing this juicy visual feast is the un-refined nature of the talent.<BR>
<BR>
<A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/18901-19200/display_Members_19136.xml" target="other">Andy Sargent</A> is a 22-year-old artist from West Hobart whose &quot;insert name here&quot; urban stencil captures more in it's simplicity than complex, layered art could often do. And the flowing beats of words from the pen of <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/20101-20400/display_Members_20298.xml" target="other">Christine Schaeffer</A>'s &quot;Delta's Blues&quot; are truly something to behold - part diary, part song and part Kerouac.  <BR>
<BR>
See artists like Canberra's <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/20401-20700/display_Members_20583.xml" target="other">Vissukamma Ratsaphong</A> getting caught up in the visual, photographic and aural energy of live bands, Brisbane's <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/19201-19500/display_Members_19357.xml" target="other">Jordan Lewerissa</A> letting his fascination with comics and Mr Bungle fuse into amazing cartoon drawings, and 18-year-old <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/20701-21000/display_Members_20885.xml" target="other">Anpha Tran</A> from Joondanna, WA, using basic computer tools like MS Paint to create his Oz punk-influenced works. <BR>
<BR>
But it's dang near impossible to give a full indication of what's in store with this 32-page supplement - you'll have to go and buy yourself a copy of JUICE to see the full picture. Maybe even find out a little bit about what Powderfinger get up to on tour while you're there - those handsome lads are on the cover.<BR>
