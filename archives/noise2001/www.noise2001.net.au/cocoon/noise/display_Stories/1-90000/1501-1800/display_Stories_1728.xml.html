<B>AUSSIE KIDS ARE REMIX KIDS</B>&nbsp;

Andrew Lancaster and his Sydney pop outfit Lino are but one of twelve artists who presented their tracks to this <B>noise</B> project for remixing, where, via triple j radio, we invited bedroom bangers Australia-wide to remix the track of their choice into a new and original sound.&nbsp;

...and by gee, if we weren't inundated. Following hot on the successful heels of the <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Links/1-90000/301-600/display_Links_451.xml">Fatboy Slim</A> remix contest, we took the idea a step further by opening up the contributions to a range of tracks from more than a single artist, and not including Mr Fatboy.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Pick my track! Pick me!&quot; were the shouts from the camps of Powderfinger, The Living End, Lino, Alex Lloyd, Paul Mac, Something For Kate, Spiderbait, The Whitlams and more, eager to pocket a warm piece of the remix pie. After all, nine out of ten nutritionists recommend remix.<BR>
<BR>
The results will speak for themselves as the tracks (selected by the bands) are playlisted on triple j during the month and profiled on site at <B>noise</B>. Just seeing what everyone did with the elements was the highlight of the project from Andrew Lancaster's perspective, he of the group Lino and sound manipulator in his own right. &quot;We had fun listening to all the tracks and were blown away by how many were submitted.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some of them were quite break-beaty, some were dark and more experimental, some were trip-hoppy and others were kinda clubby,&quot; he comments of the huge quantity of Lino remix hopefuls, &quot;...a fairly broad spread of ideas.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lancaster knows what he's talking about too, always one to dabble in the exciting world of reworking tracks from Lino to Custard and over to instrumental film arrangements. In fact he's currently working on stripping back Lino tracks into 'abstract remixes' for bandmate Lisa French's theatre show, entitled &quot;Part Time&quot; and also featuring himself and ex-Custard fella Dave McCormack.<BR>
<BR>
His favourite tools of the trade? Like many a sound nerd, Lancaster swears by his Macintosh, the ever-popular ProTools track &amp; mix software, and Reason (sampling software that operates on both Mac and PC platforms) - a setup that he heartily endorses.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm pretty heavily into Reason,&quot; Lancaster keenly states. &quot;It has lots of preset beats, but you're better off loading your own samples in, otherwise it ends up sounding... like you're using Reason! I use it as a bit of a sketch pad and then load into ProTools, which works really well.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Seeking more tips from a man in the biz, I prod for further advice, on behalf of all keen young remix enthusiasts. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The hardest thing is getting a computer that is fast enough to run these programs, but in the end it doesn't really matter what kind of gear you have,&quot; assures Lancaster. &quot;You can do your stuff on a four track if you want to. But the thing with remixing is that most people would give you a CDR of files rather than a tape - so it's more about getting programs that work well with your computer.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And what of recent comments made by old-school Aussie musicians inferring that modern low budget digital recording methods aren't like the 'good ole days' of 24 track/2 inch studio sessions?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a bit of an elitist view that only people with money can have access to things that are easy. It doesn't matter how much gear you have, you can still produce a really rotten track, and in a way a lot of things are kinda over-produced. You can do too much with stuff and sometimes the simplest things are the best.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
...just like a good cereal. <BR>
