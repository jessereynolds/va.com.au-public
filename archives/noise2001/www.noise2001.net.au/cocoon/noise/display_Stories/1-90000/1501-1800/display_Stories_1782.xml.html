<B>noise</B> is a simple idea really. It's a media festival that celebrates, promotes and gives leverage to the work of young people in the arts - the fresh thinkers of today and the creative leaders of tomorrow.&nbsp;

Running throughout the month of October, <B>noise</B> was a Commonwealth Government and Australia Council initiative that grew out of the embryo that was 1998's <B>LOUD</B> festival - aimed at letting the four million or so Australians aged 12-25 have an artistic voice on a variety of media canvasses, including print, radio, TV and online.<BR>
<BR>
 <B>noise</B> refocusses the television, reclaims the microphone and rewrites the script, to record and broadcast the attitudes and ideas of Australia's young artists, writers, musicians, filmmakers, designers, netheads and visionaries. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most of the artistic efforts are responses to call-outs open throughout 2001 to anyone and everyone aged 25 and under,&quot; summarises <B>noise</B>'s EP Brandon Saul. &quot;We didn't favour people with a professional grounding in their field or restrict call-outs to niche areas in the arts community. We're far from exclusive - and we like it that way.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
If you were from the guts of Brisbane or a remote Western Australian town, you not only had as much opportunity to express your noisiness during the festival as anyone else, but you all had equal access to see everything that went on throughout the month of October as we saw <B>noise</B> beam nationally via ABC and SBS TV, triple j, Radio National, ABC Local, community radio, a wide range of quality print publications and here on <B>noise.net.au</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In keeping with the do-it-yourself flavour of <B>noise</B>, the site allowed contributors to upload and edit their own works and profiles, while also serving as a platform where thousands of creative works could be placed on display for the world to see. Most importantly, unlike most sites out there, we made it so that <B>noise.net.au</B> is more yours than it is ours. <BR>
<BR>
Stay tuned for more news on another <B>noise</B> festival in the near future, and in the mean time, continue to check out the site for the vast catalogue of works and artist profiles. We'll also be randomly updating our 'creative people' profiles on the home page each day.<BR>
