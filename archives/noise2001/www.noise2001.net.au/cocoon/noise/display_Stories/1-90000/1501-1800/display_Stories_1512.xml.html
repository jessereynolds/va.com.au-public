Those of us choosing to voice our thoughts on the internet are well aware that the online medium is now one of the most immediate and direct ways for the individual to communicate. Not only are our words and images free from peer expectation, corporate control and government censorship, but they're available for the whole world to see if people know where to locate your stuff.&nbsp;

And letting people find you is not only a key action area of <B>noise</B>'s underlying philosophy towards all young Australian artists, it's also the basis of this digital project we call <I>E-Works</I>.  <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What has been interesting about <I>E-Works</I>,&quot; comments <B>noise</B> Online Producer and project co-ordinator Millie Lawson, &quot;is that the 'all things interactive' call-out has uncovered a proliferation of DIY sites. These sites exist in a strange and unique place - at once both intensely personal and enormously public.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>noise</B>'s <I>E-Works</I> displays the best from our selection of DIY sites, digital and varied interactive artist works, together with profiles and opinions from the talented bunch that created them.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Instead of pasting their photographs into a scrapbook, hiding their personal symposiums under their pillow and only dreaming of being able to voice their political points of view, the new generation of technically-savvy, media-minded Australians are building personal art spaces, publishing houses and online zines,&quot; says an enthused Lawson.<BR>
<BR>
And what a weird and wonderful bevy of submissions they were. Take <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/frames.xml?http&&&www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Media/1-90000/10801-11100/display_Media_10813.xml" target="other">Konrad McCarthy</A>'s wonderfully sick &quot;Humanesque&quot; site for example, incorporating absurdist shock tactics with clever methods of viewer interaction. Then compare that with the informative, issue-driven work of <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Media/1-90000/10801-11100/display_Media_10851.xml" target="other">Rachael Gill</A> and you'll get an idea of the spectrums metered here at <I>E-Works</I>.<BR>
<BR>
We asked these under-25ers a few questions too, like when they first got into web stuff, why they chose the internet as their playground, what their principal objective was, as well as their favourite sites and that kind of thing. Their answers are included in their online profiles along with other morsels of info, letting us delve a little deeper into their 'colourful' minds.<BR>
<BR>
'Colourful' is a rather understated way of describing the experimental works of <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Media/1-90000/1801-2100/display_Media_2076.xml" target="other">Sfod Among</A>, and we challenge you to find your way into Sfod's head without scratching your own for a good while prior. Check it out and you'll see what we mean. <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Media/1-90000/10801-11100/display_Media_10990.xml" target="other">Paul Abad</A>'s (post)modern music site is similarly Flash/concept heavy and also doubles as a folio of personal interests and works, proving that another level of versatility is available through these outlets.<BR>
<BR>
But the whole range of the works really has to be explored to be understood. It's also comforting to know that so many young Australians are dominating such an exciting new media niche that will no doubt (if it's not already) reward them handsomely in the future. <B>noise</B> - celebrating the digital age with <I>E-Works</I>.<BR>
