<B>YOU GO, GIRLFRIEND!</B>&nbsp;

Once upon a time - and this ain't no fairytale - the word &quot;chick&quot; was a pretty negative term, a word you'd use to refer to a girl you didn't like or for whom you didn't have a whole lotta respect.&nbsp;

						</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD align="left" valign="top"><FONT color="##666666" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="1"></FONT></TD><TD align="left" valign="top"><FONT color="#333333" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="1">

Well, praise be to feminism, hey? For now &quot;chick&quot; is a word that suggests empowerment - of being one hundred percent girl and one hundred percent go-ahead, at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
Not surprising, then, that a magazine called Chick has emerged, to explore that grrrl power even further.<BR>
<BR>
Born in Queensland, but available around Oz, the mag offers a fun look at clothes, relationships and entertainment - like a lot of other female-oriented teen mags - but with the added twist of appealing to girls who like to head into more traditionally male territories of sport and rock music, too.<BR>
<BR>
It's also a mag that celebrates the creativity of the young women who read it - so the marriage of Chick with the <B>noise</B> festival was a logical one.<BR>
<BR>
In June of 2001 we here at <B>noise</B> put out a call to Australians 25 and under to send us Chick-friendly creative work. That meant anything we could reproduce on the pages of a mag... visual art, writing, photography, you name it. <BR>
<BR>
Some artists took advantage of our broad call-out, sending in lots of different styles. <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/18001-18300/display_Members_18162.xml" target="other">Carla Gee's</A> work ranges from crisp black and white photography to clever illustrations created upon her sister's request. Also experimental are the beautiful ink paintings of <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/20701-21000/display_Members_20833.xml" target="other">Lucy Selleck</A>. These were submitted on a selection of curious, rather domestic mediums - lasagne sheets, blocks of balsa wood appropriated from a hallway, strips of canvas found in a dumpster.<BR>
<BR>
One of the really great aspects of the response to the Chick project was that we received work from both boys and girls, and not only teenagers (even though that&amp;sbquo;s the magazine&amp;sbquo;s official demograpic).<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We launched the Chick project a lot closer to the actual festival date than many of our other <B>noise</B> projects,&quot; explains the festival's print producer Tracey Grimson, &quot;but the response was still amazing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What was really interesting was that creative types who had already submitted to some of <B>noise's</B> earlier projects sent more stuff in for Chick - like the prolific <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/19501-19800/display_Members_19507.xml" target="other">Millie Fairhall</A> and <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/17701-18000/display_Members_17807.xml" target="other">Laura Thomas</A>, but we also managed to pick up new contributors such as photography based <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/21301-21600/display_Members_21328.xml" target="other">Chloe Nicholet-dit-Felix</A> too.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That was really exciting for those of us working at <B>noise</B> 'cause it meant that, the closer we got to festival time, the more new people were finding out about noise.&quot;<BR>
