<B>noise ON TV</B>&nbsp;

Throughout the month of October the unique flavour and energy of <B>noise</B> will be appearing on Australian small screens via ABC and SBS TV, as the nation's young people express their ideas and opinions through film, video, animation, music, art, design, photography and more.&nbsp;

<B>noise</B>'s intrepid TV producer Rachel Moss travelled Australia from top to bottom to discover and capture on camera what was a vast sea of raw, untapped talent. &quot;We found that just about everybody we spoke to had amazing amounts of creativity to express,&quot; Rachel says, &quot;and through spending a day with each person and having them talk direct to camera it empowered them to feel comfortable being themselves.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The core element of <B>noise</B>'s foray into television is <B>noise [tv]</B>. A weekly one hour assortment of some of the finer moments of the festival, including feature segments on creative bods from around the country, vox pops, submitted <B>noise</B> bits, short films and video clips. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There really are so many levels of artistic expression in this country - we've got graf artists, DJs, painters, writers, comic book artists, filmmakers...,&quot; observes Rachel. &quot;There's Jen Lowe, a WA artist who did these great perspective paintings down a hallway to a soup kitchen, making it appear to be getting narrower and smaller. She'd then photograph people's reactions as they approached this walkway, not knowing what to make of it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
