<B>FATBOYS, FATGIRLS, SUPERSTAR DJS - HERE WE GO...</B>&nbsp;

Coming into vogue quite noticeably in the '90s, the remix proved just as popular for the musicians (who sought fresh stylistic directions and new markets) as it did for the DJs that repackaged the tracks. &nbsp;

						</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD align="left" valign="top"><FONT color="##666666" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="1"></FONT></TD><TD align="left" valign="top"><FONT color="#333333" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="1">

Whether they were looking to score a big name for themselves in a relatively new pocket of popular music culture or not, DJs like Todd Terry and Jason Nevins had a lot of fun playing with previously popular tunes and made loads of money and industry friends in the process. <BR>
<BR>
But triple j's <I>Fatboy Slim</I> contest was slightly different in that Norman 'Fatboy' Cook was selecting his winner, and he's known for favouring the unexpected. Just ask Christopher Walken, the legendary straight-faced Hollywood actor who acts like a right fool in the film clip for the very track up for remixing. <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, point being that Luke Sparke's winning <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Media/1-90000/1501-1800/display_Media_1763.xml" target="other">'Punked Out'</A> remix is about as far from a dancefloor hit as you can get and one doubts he'll be recruited to rework expensive major label tracks as a result of it.<BR>
<BR>
Not that Sparke cares of course, the remix was something he knocked up in a day on his home PC, whilst attempting to divert his mind from his Aeronautical Engineering studies, as you do. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;When I heard the details of the competition I thought I'd like it done punk, so that's what I did,&quot; he says. &quot;At first it was almost tongue-in-cheek, but once I'd done the final mixing it actually sounded okay - dance and punk beats aren't all that different and they blend quite well.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/17701-18000/display_Members_17921.xml" target="other">Raj Menon</A>, on the other hand, went for a more traditional dance approach - citing the Chemical Brothers, Propellerheads and kung-fu fighting amongst his inspiration behind the <A hef="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Media/1-90000/901-1200/display_Media_1109.xml" target="other">'Clean For The Kids'</A> remix. <BR>
<BR>
Talking of his honourable mention for the contest, Raj says, &quot;My remix was pretty ordinary, it's been done before, but I think this kind of sound in electronic music still has a groove and an energy that keeps it popular.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Many more 'honourable mention' mixes got a guernsey, with artists using everything from didgeridoos (<A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/18001-18300/display_Members_18216.xml" target="other">Matt Warner</A>)  and bong assistance (<A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/19201-19500/display_Members_19450.xml" target="other">Neil Talty</A>) to full studio set-ups (<A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/18301-18600/display_Members_18474.xml" target="other">Rob Swire</A>) in order to pull apart and paste together Fatboy's masterpiece. Onya punters. <BR>
<BR>
