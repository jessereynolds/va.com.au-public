~ <I>Everybody was trying to create something raw and individual - not borrowed from overseas designers</I> ~ Our country's hippest and most stylish magazine just got noisier, with an exclusive supplement featuring fashions and designs from our hottest young creatives.&nbsp;

And as you can see from <I>Australian Style</I> Fashion and Beauty Director Mimi Xu's comment, a new generation of Australian style might well be at our doorstep.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Projects like the <B>noise</B> supplement are very valuable for young talent to get their work noticed, but also to encourage creativity,&quot; acknowledges Xu. &quot;Lots of people have the talent but don't have the connections to be known by the wider public - this is a good way of letting them express themselves and share their vision with the readers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
To participate in the project, young Australians with outstanding fashion or accessory design concepts were asked to submit their works to n<B>noise</B>, with some of the finalists even having their outfits professionally styled, modelled, photographed and published in October's edition of <I>Australian Style</I>.<BR>
<BR>
One such well-earned contender is <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/19801-20100/display_Members_19817.xml" target="other">Anna Moretti</A>, whose rough-around-the-edges clothing designs make no effort to conceal zippers, hems, folds, tucks or loose bits of fabric, but rather accentuates them in deliciously unconventional ways. <BR>
<BR>
In stark contrast are Anna's delicate handbag series, complete with floral embroidery and detailed ribbon, cord and fringing additions. &quot;I would describe my work as quite minimalist, simple, elegant, clean, and incorporating as much negative space and sans serif type as I can get,&quot; Anna explains. <BR>
<BR>
Similarly, the DIY/punk methods of Sally Hulse see a designer stretching the boundaries of fashion by letting her love of '80s music and time spent in New York inspire her eclectic range of denim corsages, leather-tasselled neckpieces and the like. Think Madonna, Bon Jovi and Duran Duran.<BR>
<BR>
A common thread of diversity features in all artist works throughout the supplement, from <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/20701-21000/display_Members_20856.xml" target="other">Johanna Guerin's</A> hat-making business and Scarlett Gowing's unconventional dresses and daywear to the brilliant T-shirt designs of <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/20701-21000/display_Members_20884.xml" target="other">Eyal Bernard</A> whose works are causing a bit of a ruckus in Parisian fashion circles. <BR>
<BR>
A breath of fresh air indeed, and a project where raw energy marries tidily with the big name chic you've already come to expect from <I>Australian Style</I>.<BR>
&quot;For a magazine to operate you can't only talk about new, unknown creatives,&quot; Mimi Xu says,&quot; but it is very valuable for us to showcase young talent amongst the more established features.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
