Just when you thought you had heard everything, something not too dissimilar to an under-25 coup will be infiltrating standard ABC radio transmissions, as the voice of <B>noise</B> seethes on to the airwaves. &nbsp;

From guest DJs, artists and Remix winners on triple j to new music and profiles on local ABC stations and Radio National, it's yet another way that talented young people can give their ideas an immediate impact on the ears of Australians this October.  <BR>
<BR>
One of the most obvious things you'll hear are <I>Artist Profiles</I>, aural snapshots of young artists from every part of the country, appearing sporadically throughout October programming. <BR>
<BR>
From writers and fire sculptors to dancers and designers, <B>noise</B> uncovers people like <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/19801-20100/display_Members_20043.xml" target="other">Anna Seedhouse</A>, a young writer who's words and profile will not only be featured in <B>noise</B>'s <I>Anthology</I> book, but on the radio too. <BR>
<BR>
It's typical of the fresh, funny and spontaneous work that has been submitted, and you'll hear from people like Anna across ABC on triple j's <I>Artery</I>, <I>Morning Show</I> as well as Radio National and ABC Local Radio. <BR>
<BR>
<B>noise</B> Talent Co-ordinator Kira Rea views it simply, saying, &quot;This festival is a great opportunity for young artists to get known nationally and appreciated by their local communities. But most importantly it gives them a sense of self-worth and a validity for their creative expression.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
With the diversity of contributions as wide as the country it comes from, the ABC network won't be sticking to one or two genres either. It'll be aiming to stretch the boundaries of what can and can't appear on radio, including helping to deconstruct the preconceived definitions of music, art, culture and being a young person in the 21st century. <BR>
<BR>
This is exemplified through projects like triple j's well-publicised <I>Remix</I> project, the <I>Fatboy Slim</I> contest (you know the one) and the guest spots on offer on the <I>Mix Up</I> and <I>Artery</I> programs. <BR>
<BR>
Young DIYers are taking their art forms into their own hands and away from the corporations, like  <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/20701-21000/display_Members_20723.xml" target="other">Daniel Matthews</A> whose unique brand of beat-cutting earned him one of four prized 90-minute <I>Mix Up</I> spots. Or Luke Sparke, the 22-year-old aeronautical engineering student from Victoria who got his punky home-recorded remix of Fatboy Slim's <I>Star 69</I> released on the Australian version of the single. <BR>
<BR>
As for new music, you can bet your low Aussie dollar that October will be the month for plenty of it, as triple j, Radio National and ABC Local Radio's <I>Spotlight</I> segment all dig deep to throw some fresh young fish into their collective musical biospheres for <B>noise</B>. <BR>
<BR>
Listen out for emerging artists and bands amongst regular programming too and don't be afraid to continue hassling them for your requests, even if it's your band you unashamedly want to hear.<BR>
<BR>
If you want to find out more about all artists featured on ABC Radio and other <B>noisy</B> outlets throughout October, <B>noise.net.au</B> is the site you'll need as your bible. Further links and details are also available to you at the splendidly spiffy <A href="http://www.abc.net.au/noise" target="other">ABC <B>noise</B> site</A> - check it out. <BR>
