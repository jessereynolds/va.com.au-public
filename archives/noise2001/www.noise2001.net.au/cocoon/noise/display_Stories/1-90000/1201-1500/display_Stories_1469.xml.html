In a nutshell, it's an event that celebrates, promotes and gives leverage to the work of young people in the arts. They do the work, we just facilitate it and attempt to add a lame joke or two here and there.<BR>
<BR>
<B>noise</B> is a Commonwealth Government and Australia Council initiative that grew out of the embryo that was 1998's <B>Loud</B> festival, aimed at letting the four million or so Australians aged 12-25 have an artistic voice on a variety of media canvasses.<BR>
<BR>
And as the name might suggest, it's not just for high-decibel rockers and block-rockin' beat-cutters. <B>noise</B> refocusses the television, reclaims the microphone and rewrites the script, to record and broadcast the attitudes and ideas of Australia's young artists, writers, musicians, filmmakers, designers, netheads and visionaries. One in - all in, you might say.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most of the artistic efforts you'll find are responses to call-outs open throughout 2001 to anyone and everyone aged 25 and under,&quot; summarises <B>noise</B>'s EP Brandon Saul. &quot;We haven't favoured people with a professional grounding in their field or restricted our call-outs to niche areas in the arts community. We're far from exclusive - and we like it that way.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
If you're from the guts of Brisbane or a remote Western Australian town, you not only have as much opportunity to express your noisiness during the festival as anyone else, but you'll also be able to see everything that's going on throughout the month of October as it beams nationally via ABC and SBS TV, triple j, Radio National, ABC Local, community radio, a wide range of quality print publications and here on <B>noise.net.au</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In keeping with the do-it-yourself flavour of <B>noise</B>, the site allows contributors to upload and edit their own works and profiles, while checking out the hoards of other creative bods available to see here. Unlike many sites out there, we've made it so that this one is more yours than it is ours. So let us here at <B>noise.net.au</B> guide you during the month in what's on, who's doing what and we'll hopefully have a smooth landing on the other side.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q/ - Can I still submit stuff to the festival?</B> <BR>
You bet your low Aussie dollar you can, in the form of <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Stories/1-90000/1201-1500/display_Stories_1418.xml" target="other"><I>TRUE TALES OF LOVE AND HATE</I></A> - our spunky <B>noise</B> e-zine. <BR>
