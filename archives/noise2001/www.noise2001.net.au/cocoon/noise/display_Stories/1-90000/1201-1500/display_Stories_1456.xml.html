<B>ALL NOISY ON THE SBS FRONT</B>&nbsp;

&quot;I want to create in whatever form I choose, to express myself,&quot; says artist Ben Whitaker ~ &quot;This, to lots of people, is surprisingly Australian, but natural and essential to me - I coined the term 'Austronica' to best describe my music as djX MorBid, hopefully no one else has come up with it&quot;&nbsp;

<A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/20101-20400/display_Members_20342.xml" target="other">Ben</A> isn't just a DJ that comes up with crazy names, he dabbles in digital art, painting, drawing, writing and plays in an 'extreme' band as well. Oh, and he wears a hockey mask. <BR>
<BR>
Young people like Ben will be profiled on SBS Radio's <I>Alchemy</I>, a variety segment where 'modern', 'innovative' and 'indigenous' are the key words, as well as across SBS's network of media channels throughout October. <BR>
<BR>
Artists will also be profiled in super-cool short segments on SBS TV during the month, with <I>Artist Breakers</I> uncovering the best of <B>noise</B> applicants. <BR>
<BR>
Checking out the Foong sisters, for example, should <I>definitely</I> be on your must see list. <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/20701-21000/display_Members_20738.xml" target="other">Angela</A>, Juliana and <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/21601-21900/display_Members_21710.xml" target="other">Rowena</A> Foong are the adept young Newcastle divas who have a store and fashion label entitled 'Spareparts Industries' where the focus is on used, weird fabrics and not taking themselves seriously.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, artists like the Foongs, musicians and interesting crafty types such as <A href="http://www.noise.net.au/cocoon/noise/display_Members/1-90000/21601-21900/display_Members_21713.xml" target="other">Kate Rohde</A> and her intriguing 'taxidermy' style of sculpture will have the opportunity to receive exposure through many of these SBS outlets, including the web. <BR>
<BR>
Then there's SBS's <I>Whatever</I> - audio features created by second year radio students from Sydney's Macquarie University that take inspiration from the words 'noise' or 'justice' - ending in top notch soundscapes, current affairs features, radio plays and more. Check it out at the <A href="http://www.sbs.com.au/whatever" target="other"><I>Whatever</I></A> website for more info on the project and its artists. <BR>
<BR>
 <B>noise</B> also joined with SBS Language Radio to find those applicants who came from cultures other than western, those who speak languages other than English. And in a sort of 'spreading the joy' way, <B>noise</B> and SBS have widened the arts media initiative to penetrate other sectors of the community. <BR>
<BR>
Hopefully the next festival will unearth more hidden talent from deeper within these valuable areas, and you can expect to hear truckloads of such artists profiled this year.<BR>
<BR>
Be sure to keep wandering through the vast vaults of <B>noise</B> profiles and info on our site, while sussing out the scene over on SBS. If soccer, indie film, the best world news or <I>South Park</I> are already in your bag o' favourites, stay right where you are for the October <B>noise</B> onslaught. <BR>
<BR>
If, on the other hand, you're not already a regular - you'll soon discover what all the hoo-har is all about as you listen to, watch and surf the serene sanctuary of SBS.<BR>
