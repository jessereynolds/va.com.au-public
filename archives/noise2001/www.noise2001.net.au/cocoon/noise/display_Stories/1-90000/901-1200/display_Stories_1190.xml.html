Before the noise festival was even a twinkle in the eye of our friends in the Commonwealth Government, the folks at Voiceworks were busy getting young creative types exposed by publishing them in their mag. &nbsp;

<B>Describe Voiceworks:</B><BR>
A national quarterly magazine, published by Express Media, featuring writing and visual art by people under 25 - fiction, non-fiction, interviews, essays, reviews, poetry, photography, illustrations, comics and anything else we can print. We're funded by the Australia Council and Arts Victoria to be the only national publication that exists to publish the work of young people. <BR>
<BR>
We also focus on encouraging Australia's flourishing independent media culture. We follow the traces of culture-jammers, independent film-makers, community radio stations, zinesters, hacktivists, writers, artists and freedom fighters everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
Voiceworks is a magazine like no other in Australia; it's run independently, for and by young people instead of using 'youth' as a niche demographic to market towards. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What does Voiceworks do?</B><BR>
In a broad sense, Voiceworks offers a means of expression for young people to get the word out. Often when people say 'young people' they only mean the hipster inner-city folk, the 'cutting-edge types' who get featured in magazines. Voiceworks has as diverse and different a field of contributors, organisers and readers as possible.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>What is your role?</B><BR>
Officially, I'm the Editor: I'm in charge of every part of the Voiceworks process, from talking to writers, through design and production to organising the launch! But a lot of my job involves facilitating other (younger) people in learning how to do all the different parts of running the magazine. Part of that is 'managing' an Editorial Committee made up of people aged between 15 and 24, who make all the tough decisions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>How did you come to work at Voiceworks?</B><BR>
At uni I was involved in student media, and then started getting various bits of writing published in strange places - one of which was Voiceworks. Someone asked me to be part of the Editorial Committee in late 1999 - it was pretty amazing to be part of a team of people who cared about a publication enough to spend their nights and days making it happen. Nine months later, I'd gotten so involved that when the Editor's job came up, I went for it. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What resources/services does Voiceworks offer artists?</B><BR>
Well, obviously, we offer publication opportunities for all kinds of writers and artists. But Voiceworks is also a conduit for sharing skills - writing, editing, arts administration, publicity and promotion - through getting involved in the running of the magazine itself. Express Media is a small arts organisation: we rely very heavily on time donated by volunteers. That happens in every facet of the magazine's production - from editing, proofing and design to less easily defined skills like figuring out the look and feel, direction and focus of the magazine. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Describe some recent activities that your organisation has been involved in?</B><BR>
Express Media run practical workshops in all kinds of media (based in Melbourne), and are also funded to match up young writers and older, established writers for intensive mentorships nation-wide. We also recently released a national anthology of new writing entitled Tiny Epics.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How did Voiceworks evolve?</B><BR>
It began life in 1990 as a pretty rough'n'raw zine, sent to Express Media members, and slowly evolved into the big, crazy magazine it is now, attracting government funding and a huge readership along the way.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How can artists become involved with Voiceworks?</B><BR>
Send your stuff to us, anytime. Become a member of Express Media so you can get the magazine and the newsletter delivered to your door. Come to workshops. Volunteer your time as a proof-reader. Or if you're a shy, retiring type, just pick up a copy of the mag every three months.<BR>
