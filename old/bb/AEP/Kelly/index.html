<p><b>Ned Kelly</b> is one of the very few Australian historical figures whose name is known to virtually all Australians. Although Ned, at the age of 25 was convicted and hanged as a common outlaw by the British establishment, most Australians accept him to be a hero. Indeed to this very day he is considered to be a revolutionary. This view is supported by the fact that Ned Kelly, in company with a gang of three, attempted to attack a police troop train at Glenrowan station in Victoria.
<p>Only now, 115 years after his execution, Australians finally have the courage to vocalize republican sentiments without fear of British reprisal. Those not familiar with the story of Ned Kelly will find it enlightening to do some basic research on the short but courageous life of the man.
<p>Superbly painted by Australian artist <B>Rick Radahanichekevski</B> - <I>know by some as 'the Rembrant of South Australia' for his unique ability to reproduce works of art painted by the great masters of the Renaissance</I> - this compelling portrait of Edward (Ned) Kelly reveals "the man behind the mask" as never seen before.
<p><B>Rick Radahanichekevski</B> was specifically chosen and commissioned to paint this stunning portrait by Arthur Wunderlich, currently studying psychology and sociology at Deakin University in Victoria.
