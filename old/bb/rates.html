<h1>So what does a stall in the<br><a href="http://www.camtech.com.au/~virtart/clients/bb/">Bizarre Bazaar</a> actually cost?</h1>
</center>
<p><font size=+2>S</font><font size=+1>talls in the <a href="http://www.camtech.com.au/~virtart/clients/bb/">Bizarre Bazaar</a> are cheap.  Cheap as chips to quote a well known phrase.

<p>For only <font size=+3>$300</font>.00 you get a web page in the Bizarre Bazaar, and then, for the next four web pages you pay only $200.00 per page.  We call that our stall design and construction fee.
<p>Then, because there's no use in having a stall in the <a href="http://www.camtech.com.au/~virtart/clients/bb/">Bizarre Bazaar</a> when no-one knows it's there, for another <font size=+3>$100</font>.00 we'll actively go out and promote your site in as senstive a way as is possible.  We will not 'spam' the net with your product or service, but we will advise relevent newsgroups, listservers and people of your product, and we will research other links that your site can have to help people find out more about what it is you're getting at.
<p>To top it all off there's a <font size=+3>$50</font>.00 per month stall rental fee, payable one month in advance until you decide it should be removed.  Just say no to cyberspace-junk.

To order your stall in the <a href="http://www.camtech.com.au/~virtart/clients/bb/">Bizarre Bazaar</a>, or simply to find out more, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:virtart@camtech.com.au">virtual artists pty ltd</a>, with subject 'bizarre bazaar'. Thanks.
<p>Please note that all dollar figures quoted here are Australian dollars.
<p>Should you require some really special web site work done feel free to <a href="mailto:virtart@camtech.com.au">send us some e-mail</a>. We can do the lot, from graphics to site design to html coding to custom software development. Open most hours.  Phone +61 8 361 2033 to talk to us in person.
