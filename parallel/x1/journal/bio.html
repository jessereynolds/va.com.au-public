<FONT SIZE=5>It is said that Christina Onassis feared her stepmother and it appears that she had good reason. While Jackie shopped, Greece's 'first' family was almost entirely wiped out. Witch or goddess, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to have brought tragedy back to the land of its origins.
<p>
A cynical excercise in hybridity, <I>By the light of the
eternal flame</I>  is more Mills and Boon  than cultural theory. This short piece by David Broker attempts to analyse the legend of Jackie O without compromising the sycophancy and non-criticality of the texts in which her multi-faceted persona was constructed.

<FONT SIZE=5>"She was three years old and watched fixated, for hours, as blood poured out of her father's mouth": so begins a story, a story in which one image leads to another, in which one country leads to another, in which personal memory leads to public history.</FONT><p><HR size=4 width=200>

<FONT SIZE=5>Ways are suggested for reading brief glimpses of theories, ideas or histories, revealed as fragments embedded within a larger text. Such moments of intersection allow ways of interfacing between knowledges, they suggest the power of ornamentation, reveal the hybridity of any text, they permit access to other layers of metaphoricity. This paper explores such ideas in two texts - one by Lacan, the other by Jung - and follows the
various weaves within and between them.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=5><I>Decoding Perversity</I> examines the significant
differences in the construction of desire between the genetically
engineered female replicants from Ridley Scott's techno-noir film <I>Blade Runner</I>, and VNS Matrix' computer-generated DNA Sluts from the art video game <I>All New Gen</I>.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=5>Execution: too much, and too far beyond the memory of living, of to-be-alive... it's the excess which deals with excess... there are slow and sudden and expected deaths... and execution can be all of these at once. Lispector wrote: "Ah, this flash of instants never ends. Will my song of <I>it</I> never end? I'm going to end it deliberately, with a voluntary act. But it continues on in constant improvisation, creating always and forever the present which is the future."</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=5>" ... The setting and the characters were, so often <B>of</B>, considerable difference to those which I was used to: Nigel Strangeways, the detective in the novel, consumed more cigarettes than any hero I had read of before, (although Biggles had managed to tuck a few away), and was <B>strange</B> with bizarre quirks - such as insisting that his bed was piled heavy with quilts, so that he could hardly move, a peccadillo that only made some sort of sense later when I found out that the author (who left <B>clues</B> of another life as C. Day Lewis, Poet Laureate) based
Strangeways on Auden, who was said to <I>have</I> had the same habit."
