<tr><td><FONT SIZE=+1>She was three years old and watched fixated, for hours, as blood poured out of her father's mouth.</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>She knew that once they reached home the bleeding would stop, but even though they drove fast - away from town, toward the farm - nothing changed, the dusty brown landscape never varied and the dirt road simply stretched endlessly into the distance. She sat in the front (a rare privilege) next to her mother, who was driving. By peering around the seat she could see her father lying in the back of the car holding a handkerchief up to his mouth. She imagined the old farmhouse - immense, implacable and comforting with its greying thatched roof and white washed walls; but even as she conjured it into existence she could see it shrinking, contracting to nothing. This is how she came to understand the
phrase 'to bleed to death'. He held a handkerchief up to his mouth and as
it grew red and sodden he grunted like a hostage, bound and gagged. "Don't
try to talk," her mother said as she groped in her handbag for another
hanky, small and flimsy, embroidered white-on-white. All the while she kept
driving, kept her eyes on the road ahead.</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>When her father had told her, early that morning, that they
were going to town to visit the dentist who was going to pull all his teeth
out she was deeply envious, imagining all the money he would get from the
tooth fairy. Now in the car so far from home she feels remorse, as though
her envy has animated these butchering demons of retribution.</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>She wants to put something in her mouth too.</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>"I gave them gold coins, and they ate the coins and made
themselves ill," Columbus said.</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>He used to say to my mother when she raged, "Belt up Misery
Guts!" Or to us kids when we screamed and yelled: "Put a sock in
it!"</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>Columbus narrates in his diary the following incident: when he
first encountered the natives (on coming ashore, having discovered a new
land which would come to be known as America) he wished to demonstrate his
good will and so offered them evidence of his pacific intentions, in the
form of a gift. But they did not understand the principles of exchange. He
says something like "for when I showed them swords they did grasp them by
their blades and so did cut themselves." The person from whom I heard this
story interpreted Columbus's actions not so much as military or political,
but as a series of speech acts. He saw this narration as a proclamation,
and stressed the way that Christopher Columbus is constantly declaring,
witnessing, recording. Perhaps this is so, but on hearing this story I was
immediately struck  by something else, some other reverberation. I was
struck by the act of disavowal.</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>I wanted to put something in my mouth too.</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>And this disavowal seemed to me to be embodied in the fleshy
slide from sword to pen. Slide or substitution. In writing his diary, which
is to become the basis of an enduring colonial history, Columbus is
performing a complex manoeuvre. In the very moment of elimination, of
writing 'the natives' out, he is giving an interpretation which holds them
responsible. On some level, though no doubt not a conscious one, he
registers guilt. And transfers it. If we think of the sword as a pen, then
this is what he is saying: "they were given the opportunity and they seized
it inappropriately. They wrote themselves out of history. Witness the
spectacle of self-mutilation." He converts his guilt, and will proceed to
try and convert (to Christianity) those to whom he gives gifts.</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>You put a cigarette in your mouth to stop the bleeding, as a
stop-gap measure, to plug the hole and stop the blood from pouring
out.</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>Even though you know his teeth have been drawn, his flashing
smile is false, you are still afraid. Perhaps you are afraid precisely - or
imprecisely - because you know this. And so you turn your fear to pleasure
and light up another cigarette. And write a story.
