<P>
23. Each of the aesthetic strategies discussed above
(techno-war, abjection, postmodern) is developed in subsequent chapters [of <I>A Bright Flash in Dark Rooms,</I> see note on author], but it is worthwhile here to compare the development of the representation of nuclear war in two
films, <I>Above and Beyond</I> (1952), which stands at the beginning of this
history of films, and <I>By Dawn's Early Light,</I> a very recent film
(1990). In
the early development of nuclear war films, stories about the bomb could be
linked to the stories about World War II, about the sacrifices and about
the necessity of everyone doing his or her bit. The images tend to ape those
of the documentary, especially where images are needed which have sufficient
realism to convince the filmgoer of their authenticity. Footage from the
atomic tests  in the deserts of the American west, from the bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki (and later, footage of the even more impressive
hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific) was grafted into what we now would call
docudramas such as <I>Above and Beyond</I>.
<P>
24. Of special importance in this film is the symbolic shift which substituted
the bomb as the metonym of a technological system. Portrayed as lying at the
heart of the most secret projects, at the center of the American war effort,
the ultimate weapon which would end the war with a minimum of allied
casualties, the atomic bomb contained in kernel form the characteristics and
qualities of the system which produced it, a system which fused technology
and the military. This portrayal helped to establish the tradition which
subsequent films would build on, showing how  the nuclear system required
changes in people's lives.
<P>
25. In this film, Robert Taylor portrays Paul Tibbets, the pilot of the <I>Enola
Gay</I> which dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. This film is remarkably like
<I>Twelve
O'Clock High</I> and similar war films in its rendering of the subplot of
conformity vs. individualism, seen as the necessity of the maverick learning
to be a team player. In fact, within this central dilemma is the narrative
impetus which brings forth the other classic conflicts in American
literature and cinema: adventure-domesticity, individual-community, worldly
success-ordinary life <FONT SIZE=3>(Ray 1985, p. 186)</FONT>. In this case
the bomber pilot,
chosen initially for this special mission because of his individuality, must
in turn surrender each of his personally favored choices for the dictates of
the mission and of the bomb. Above all, his individuality is sacrificed; he
must become a corporation man. This necessarily carries him into the
adventure of flying the plane, bringing up conflicts between him and his
wife, Lucy (played by Eleanor Parker), but in the end all is justified when
worldly success, defined ideologically in terms of the success of the
mission and the delivery of the bomb, is finally made public. His wife
understands at last what she had only wondered about before: his mission was
truly more important than their marriage and private life, and so her
sacrifices and losses were justified.
<P>
26. Some critics were disappointed with the segments of this film
"concentrating on the personal aspect" of the history of the bomb <FONT
SIZE=3>(Crowther
1953)</FONT>. Crowther went on to call this segment of the film, "a meretricious
sham of painful domestic relations." Another reviewer saw this concentration
as a "considerable drawback ... that is handled in the picture in a trite,
overlong, and crucially interruptive fashion" <FONT SIZE=3>(New Yorker, 2 Feb 1953, p.
77)</FONT>. When the film "gets down to its main business," ie. the story of the
bomb, this reviewer found it "straightforward and solid." Although it is
primarily the acting of the domestic scenes which the reviewers dislike,
they express their greatest satisfaction with the flight scenes, Crowther
finding them realistic and "crisply and efficiently portrayed." Yet one must
wonder if it is so much the acting which was upsetting to these critics as
it was that the personal story interfered with the telling of a tale which
all wanted to see: the tale of the atomic bomb which was still fresh in the
public's mind.
<P>
27. Whatever their reasons, these critics, through their displeasure,
illustrate the fundamental conflict of the narrative: the stories formed
around the narratives of systems logic and technicism are incompatible with
stories of human life. Systems values and human life are irreconcilable, and
even the two story lines which develop from these two domains battle each
other. Ideologically, the stories seem dissonant and demand a resolution in
favor of one or the other. Especially when the conflict between the two of
them is so one-sided, the technicistic will win, for as it emerges out of
the structures of state power, the technicistic wraps itself in the
trappings of ideology and myth. The dissatisfaction of critics suggests a
flaw in what should be the seamless representation of the dominant,
'realist' reading. It suggests as well that life within the system is
antithetical to human life.
<P>
28. The film works as a whole by setting up the traditional problem of
individuality and establishing critique within this area. As a consequence
of his accepting a part in the development of one aspect of the atom bomb
project, Tibbets is in conflict with his wife and with the system.  These
conflicts are then contained within the necessary and justifiable sacrifice
to the larger system which has as its core the secret of the atomic bomb.
The film opens in real time so that the rest of the film is told as a series
of flashbacks with an elliptical suspension of resolution.
<P>
29. Lucy is waiting at the airport for him to return, again. She tells us that
she has always waited for the sound of engines which mark the return of her
husband from service to the system. As she waits, she ponders whether she
and Paul still have a marriage. It is her narrative which sets the central
conflict of the film: domestic life vs. the demands of the nuclear system,
the war machine. The conflict is set in her point of view, although we do
see his side of it, and through the film she represents the familial, the
domestic and, paradoxically for American film, the individual.  She does not
represent the entanglements of family and marriage, as in so many war films
and adventure stories where the woman was often the domesticating influence
which threatened the individuality of the hero. In such films the family was
defined in opposition to the frontier and the quest. In this film, though,
and in many films following the second war, the family is defined in
opposition to the military machine and the telos of the mission. Life exists
in a suspension outside of the military. The old conflict of the hero
attempting to escape the familial is recast and recontained as the hero's
striving to reconcile the two loyalties which are linked only at a
superficial, ideological level while as narratives they are in opposition
and mutually exclusive.
<P>
30. The hero in <I>Above and Beyond</I> still retains his individuality,
but now it is
defined in terms of his loyalty to  his men, his pragmatism in the face of
the bureaucracy and his family life in opposition to the military system's
new demands. The first we see of Tibbets is in the cockpit of his plane on a
bombing mission. He and his comrades are being badly mauled by enemy flak
because they are forced to fly too low in the interests of bombing accuracy.
This establishes the second point of critique: he is at odds with his
superiors, in this case an armchair general who makes decisions based on
statistics without considering his men. The protagonist's criticism is so
harsh that it borders on insubordination and generates a running subtheme:
the bitter and petty bureaucrat who is, still, stymied by the system and its
justice.
<P>
31. However, it is precisely this criticism which calls the visiting general's
attention to Tibbits. This general is looking for someone to test-fly and
help develop the new B-29 bomber. Of four pilots under consideration,
Tibbits is chosen over the objections of his commander. Thus, the critique
raised by the conflict with his immediate superior is defused. The film
shows that while there may be a few bad apples, a few incompetent
commanders, the system as a whole, and most of the personnel in it, are
dedicated not to their own beliefs but to the beliefs and values of the
system. The system apparently wants those in command decisions to retain
some element of the individual, of the maverick, and as we see later in the
film, it has devices for ensuring that this individuality never gets too far
out of hand. The most effective of these is security.
<P>
32. Security pervades the Manhattan project, and in so doing it provides the
motivation for much of the subsequent drama in this film. The bomb is cut
off from the ordinary world, isolated by the activities supervised by the
security officer (James Whitmore). Actually, it is not the bomb which is cut
off from people but people who are denied access to each other and to
ordinary lives. Even Tibbets and his wife find themselves followed,
investigated and handled. The military gaze, incarnated as Security,
encroaches into the most intimate of domestic settings. When Tibbets'
relationship with his wife begins to encroach on the mission, the security
officer suggests that he send his wife away from the base, even though less
senior personnel have their families here. Lucy even once approaches the
security officer, demanding to know what about the base and the mission is
so important. She threatens that she will find out. She believes that her
desire to know is justified, and within a normal frame of human reference,
it would be. She tells him that she wishes to know if it is the mission
which is so important or if her husband has in fact changed, depriving her
of the expected satisfaction of desire, cast in the myth of the day as the
happy marriage.
<P>
33. Feeling her desire stymied, she does not seek other ways in which her
desire may be satisfied because she does not understand what it is. The film
does not explore alternative readings of motivation which might lead beyond
'appropriate' resolutions. The dominant patriarchal mythos, already firmly
established in the culture, placed the obtaining of a husband as the focus
of a woman's activity; the fulfillment of her desires is to be the
production of the family. When this desire comes into opposition with the
military system, with the necessity of duty - which is being established as
the new patriarchal myth - the central conflict emerges, if only briefly. The
new myth must contain the conflict, establishing new hierarchies of personal
and social value.
<P>
34. We, the viewers, see that she cannot be taken seriously. We are, after all,
already on the inside of the story through our identification with Paul
Tibbets. The scene does not end on her but on the security agent after she
leaves. He places her under surveillance, lest in her desire to understand
her life she should jeopardize the mission. Almost every attempt which she
makes to restore contact with her husband is short circuited or rebuffed.
Lucy is cut off from Paul, and  he is completely cut off from everything
which is not the mission, not the military. This is part of the telos of the
bomb. Although his men hate him and his wife doesn't understand, the system
remains paramount in importance, supplanting the human relationships with
command and control. The system even denies Paul the possibility of the
company of other men as a substitute and emotional surrogate, a favorite
plot rendering in American literature and film <FONT SIZE=3>(Fiedler 1966)</FONT>.
<P>
35. Through the creation of a conflict between the person and the corporation,
the possibility of resolving the tension between self and system was raised.
This reflected in microcosm the new American role as a global political
power. No longer could isolationism be entertained even as a fantasy.
Similarly, the individual person could no longer escape the snares of
civilization. The problematic separation of self from the system creates the
dynamic narrative tension of such films, and this tension seeks resolution
in an ideologically satisfying reconciliation. "The reconciliation pattern
found its most typical incarnation ... in one particular narrative: the
story of a private man attempting to keep from being drawn into action on
any but his own terms." <FONT SIZE=3>(Ray 1985, p. 65)</FONT>. Here it is the
corporation - manifested either as the military or as the technological
system itself - which is in turn formulated around the principles of the
nuclear system which the individual must resist.
<P>
36. The individual mentioned here is, of course, male; women in this film don't
have the option of acting on their own terms. The dilemna raised by the
separation of self from the system, from the world of power, recapitulates a
central problem with which women in the West have long had to contend. Only
when this is presented as a male problem, though, is it considered worthy of
dramatic, filmic treatment. Perhaps this is true precisely because it
threatens to locate men in a position long identified as feminine. So the
experience of powerlessness, of having to accept the will of others for
one's life, must be reclaimed and placed within the male domain.
<P>
37. In the end, reconciliation comes not through the resolution of the conflict
between Tibbits and the system, but after the completion of the mission.
Only then does his wife learn of the supreme importance of Tibbets' having
served the system, and only then does she accordingly devalue her existence
with him to being less important. She does this willingly, lovingly. And so
she, too, comes to serve the military machine. The film does not end with
scenes of a happy life of reconciliation between Paul and Lucy. The hope of
blissful domesticity is upheld, but the film doesn't deliver it. Instead,
the film shows only that Lucy's sacrifices were worthwhile and necessary.
<P>
38. In the conflict between her local reality and the military-technological
system which threatens it, we see a microcosmic portrayal of the dilemma of
life in the industrial age. C. Wright Mills <FONT SIZE=3>(1956, p.
321)</FONT> wrote that:
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"in every major area of life, the loss of a sense
of structure and the
submergence into powerless milieux is the cardinal fact. In the military it
is most obvious, for here the roles men play are strictly confining; only
the command posts at the top afford a view of the structure of the whole,
and moreover, this view is a jealously guarded official
secret."</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

39. Lucy is kept from knowing the exclusive vision, and she cannot know more
than her milieu, although the system's demands and values permeate and
buffet her life.
<P>
40. Poor Lucy. Recruited first into the myth of being a good wife and keeping a
happy home, Lucy is understandably confused and frustrated when the major
self-object in her life suddenly ceases to be what she had expected. She did
everything right, and the rules of melodrama (rooted in middle-class values)
require a payoff. Yet to give Lucy what she wants and simultaneously
maintain the valorization of the system would resolve the unresolvable
cultural conflict which lies at the heart of the new myth. By placing out of
reach the primary object of desire, ie. the spouse and marriage, these
become even more desirable. Because her suffering was for such a noble
cause, she inoculates the film readers against their own disappointments.
The difference now is that fate, class, misfortune no longer stand as the
immovable barriers to mythic fulfillment. Now the nuclear military system,
and all that it stands for, assumes these burdens.
<P>
41. She cannot transcend her dilemna, for the system denies her access to the
view which alone can explain her suffering. She must play Job to the
military's Jehovah. Her connection with the system is indirect, through her
husband, and so she has no way of meaningfully integrating her history,
contained in the earlier myth, with the new myth posited by the military and
the state. The ideology operating behind this film, motivating the action
and processes of signification, suggests that her powerlessness is
necessary. Understanding is not required, only obedience, loyalty, and
patriotism. When she is afforded a fleeting view from the top, her vision of
her own milieu is transfixed within the relatively much more important
official structure. As a representative of the mundane world, she is given
understanding of the nomos which justifies her sacrifice. This vision of the
system stands as the modern, nuclear epiphany.
