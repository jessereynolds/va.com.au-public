<P>
42. The system to which the characters in <I>Above and
Beyond</I> must be educated is
already complete and entire in the 1990 cable tv  release, <I>By Dawn's Early
Light.</I> This is one of the few films which actually follow the cause,
development, conduct and termination of a nuclear war. The makers of this
film do not need to educate their viewers into a representational system;
the previous forty years have already constructed it for them.
The nuclear system had become well known to every person living in the
industrialized world. An entire generation had grown up inside of the
system, knowing its reality with intimate, threatening details. Countless
films, documentaries, school drills, comic books, novels, and nightmares
have transformed the nuclear epiphany into mundane reality. There is thus no
need to educate and convince the characters in this film of the necessity or
attributes of nuclear systems as in <I>Above and Beyond.</I> The military
metaphysics into which films made in the preceding 45 years educated their
characters (and so the audiences) has permeated the whole of the life world
as both a quotidian way of existence and an autonomous event process which
could erupt at any time, overwhelming the merely human.
<P>
43. The resulting nuclear simulacrum reveals the film readers' familiarity with
the stock signifiers by reducing them to shorthand images and scenes. No
longer is it necessary to show mushroom clouds and towering fireballs - only
one such image appears in this film which has several nuclear explosions.
The same familiarity holds for the nuclear system as a whole.
<P>
44. The system which we saw being elaborated in <I>Above and Beyond</I> is
sufficiently entrenched that the expert pronouncements, the scientific and
military projections are the taken-for-granted truths which this film can
present as the real. The portrayals of SAC headquarters at Omaha, Nebraska;
of the B-52's and the various crew members' occupations, of the 'Looking
Glass' airborne command post, are sufficiently familiar to the audience that
argot, slang and even operational procedures are simply mentioned without
explanation. One hears of the SIOP (Single Integrated Operation Plan, a
computer generated series of recommended responses to various scenarios), of
ECM (electronic counter measures), EWO (emergency war orders) and the rest
of the alphabet soup of military acronyms. Similarly, the electronic
plotting boards are so familiar to the film reader that their simulated
reality, upon which the
military commanders must act, is unquestioned.
<P>
45. That such a shorthand is used suggests that the reader is simultaneously
close to the filmic nuclear simulacrum and removed from it. Through the
historical elaboration of filmic portrayals of nuclear explosions, it is now
sufficient to show only intense flashes of light, followed by some local
blast damage, to signify the nuclear explosion. We have witnessed the
evolution of a metonymic device through the use of the same effect in films
such as  <I>Testament,</I> and <I>Miracle Mile.</I> Or the explosion can be
shown as the
blotches which appear on radar screens and the screens' subsequent fuzziness
and static, caused by the electromagnetic interference which the bomb
generates. In both cases, the representation of the explosion reduces the
bomb to its effects, closing the gap between reality and representation,
showing the bomb's explosion as pure light which inscribes its reality
directly onto the world. We see here another example of what Virilio calls
the derealization of the military vision; "nuclear weapons inherited both
the darkroom of Niepce and Daguerre and the military searchlight" <FONT
SIZE=3>(Virilio
1989, p. 81)</FONT>. Their light intrudes directly into reality,
illuminating it,
freezing it.
<P>
46. The people inside the system, though now presented in new, up to date
gender roles, are still caught inside a system which is inimical to their
merely human lives. One of the subplots follows a B-52 crew commanded by the
pilot (Powers Boothe) and co-pilot (Rebecca de Mornay). They have been
having a romance, highlighted with the establishing shot of the film's first
scene which rakes in on a cheap motel, following the two into the room. They
are both Air Force officers, and in the context of their profession, this
romance is illicit. Boothe's character explains that military protocol holds
this fraternization counterproductive to their first duty, the Air Force.
And this is indeed shown to be the case.
<P>
47. When duty calls, they answer. Even so, she is less crisp and efficient than
he. She is allowed to show the human concern in a meaningful way. Another
airman, realizing that his new wife is dead, behaves irrationally, but De
Mornay's character, though emotional, is not in the sense borne by the
audience, irrational. She questions and comments upon their orders, and it
is she who asks for confirmation of the 'go' order. Finally, she is the one
who with her offer to sacrifice herself, convinces the pilot to call off the
attack. Only from within the military system are her actions questionable.
She is our  counterpoint to the military view, our conscience finds voice in
hers.
<P>
48. It would seem that this couple have neatly resolved the problem of the
Tibbets. Within the system, wearing their blue uniforms they maintain a
professional distance and working relationship, while off duty, and hence
outside of the system, they have a torrid romance complete with the usual
domestic squabbles. She is unhappy that he wishes to keep the two realms so
distinctly different. She is less easily able to bifurcate her life into two
incommensurable spheres, but yet she does not express a desire to leave the
military.  Two narratives compete for acceptance. The first is the vision of
the military system, and this is acceptable to the extent that it
successfully excludes other points of view. Human relationships are not
detected on the radar  screens or on the big electronic plotting boards. The
second is the positioning of people within the system as functioning parts
of it while yet retaining a human perspective with which the audience can
identify. This plurality of codes creates an expectation for order, for
resolution and closure <FONT SIZE=3>(See Barthes 1975, pp. 75-7)</FONT>.
The two narrative
worlds cannot co-exist indefinitely, and the tension between them appears as
both dramatic tension and as personal conflicts for the characters.
<P>
49. Personal conflict appears often as a division of consciousness between two
interpretive possibilities which are predicated by two signifying codes. In
<I>By Dawn's Early Light</I> this dilemma is raised to a problematic  when De
Mornay's character is unwilling to drop the bombs and finally succeeds in
talking the pilot out of continuing the mission. The bomber has been ordered
on the 'Grand Tour,' ie. a bombing mission which is aimed at killing the
major military and governmental figures in the Soviet Union. She refuses to
participate. In part her reticence arises because she questions the logic of
striking the Soviet command, which would leave no one to stop the war, to
turn it off. However, she is also uncomfortable knowing that she will be
killing civilians. Murder is for her too personal; she yet feels
responsibility for her actions. The feelings voiced by her character appear
only as they depart the realm of the possible. Electronic simulations,
training, the isolated and rarified cockpit of the plane itself eliminate
any real contact with death. Her concern is abstract just as is killing.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Victory Over Time</FONT>
<P>
50. Her refusal sparks a terse exchange between herself and the
pilot. The pilot says: "You'd turn the key in a Minute Man silo in a
minute." She explains that there one has no time to think.  Much of the
dramatic line of <I>Dawn's Early Light</I> is built around the impossibility of
acting in real time on events too complex to understand yet too important to
ignore. Is the detected second launch by the Soviets aimed at the U.S.? If
so a counter-attack must be launched immediately before the warheads from
the first launch destroy the C3I (Command, Control, Communications and
Intelligence) infrastructure of the U.S. forces.
<P>
51. The other subplot follows the President (Martin Landau), who after a
helicopter crash is out of touch and believed dead for a while, and his
successor, the Secretary of the Interior (Darren McGaven) as they attempt to
understand the details of the war and  plan appropriate actions (and
especially responses) to the Soviet missile launches. The Soviets, having
been struck by a missile launched by dissident forces within the Soviet
Union itself, have launched a limited counter-strike against United States
bases. The President in turn launches a limited counter-strike against
similar Soviet targets in retaliation. At this point, while he is being
evacuated, the President's helicopter crashes.
<P>
52. While the President is incapacitated and out of touch with the military,
the Interior Secretary must interpret the scenarios and schemes which
various military officers put to him. His dilemma is in deciding whom to
believe, which version of a complex situation is most accurate. His is not a
gaze from vantage point of uninterrupted truth. He has only the rapidly
dissolving computer evaluations, interpretations from remote sensors to go
on and these compete with the biases and sense of history of his military
advisors. As such, his gaze is tenuous and as the bombs and missiles
continue to explode, it fragments, like a shattering mirror. In the face of
the collapse of positive control, ideology and personal psychology supplant
the command structure.
<P>
53. He will attack the Soviets not because the computer suggests that this is
an appropriate response but because he believes that victory is both
possible and necessary. Communications are in shambles, both in the U.S. and
in the U.S.S.R. Without communication systems, neither the nuclear system
nor the image of the world in relation to the nuclear system can be
visualized and so controlled. Vision is all. The destruction of the enemy's
access to this vision, of the ability to see the whole of the system and of
the situation all at once in its electronic and military simulation is one
version of victory.
<P>
54. This version of victory is not the only possible outcome, though, and a
dramatic tension develops between the Secretary's resolution and another one
which is more acceptable because it is held by more 'reasonable' characters.
The viewer is led to  identify with certain characters within the military
system: "Alice" (James Earl Jones in the Looking Glass airborne command
post), the President (Martin Landau) and the bomber crew. These characters
are more believable because they do not believe that an all out nuclear war
can be survived, and most of their actions are aimed at preventing this type
of nuclear war, at 'turning it off'. The film reader has been educated to
this as well. It is reasonable to believe, based on preceding films, expert
pronouncements and news which are public domain, that a limited nuclear
attack might be 'survived'. Though it is commonly accepted that a full-scale
nuclear attack would be utterly catastrophic and eschatological.
<P>
55. On the other hand, the Secretary of Interior (McGaven) and
 the Army colonel who advises him continue to operate in a cold war
mentality, expecting the worst from the Soviets and preparing to retaliate
in full. These two have apparently not been persuaded by the thaw in
Soviet-U.S. relations. Thus one discourse prevalent in the real world finds
itself mirrored in the filmic. Those who accept the 'new world order' of
cooperation and dialogue appear heroic while more conservative positions
lead to war, ruin, destruction.
<P>
56. Interestingly, the conservatives do not trust the system. This film shows
that a 'pause' has been built into the U.S. forces' computer generated
response which allows for a delay of several hours before the submarines
fire their missiles, thus allowing the leaders on both sides a chance to
reflect, piece together the situation and perhaps stop the continued
escalation of conflict. Neither the Secretary nor the colonel trusts either
the Soviets or the system, and they set into motion the plans to raise the
conflict to a full-scale nuclear war.
<P>
57. However, even in this Gotterdammerung, everything must happen within the
rule of law, according to procedures. 'Alice' will not countermand the
orders of the Secretary. The military waits for the command codes to come
from the 'proper' authorities. Even nuclear war is not sufficient reason for
senior officers to disobey obviously bad orders.  More junior officers,  the
bomber crew, do decide to disobey, and they are marked for annihilation by
their own side. The system, even when it is wrong, is obeyed and trusted by
most. It is more real than real. Believing only the simulation of their
reality, people cannot counterpoise alternatives to it. They are little more
than relays in a switching circuit.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>The Nuclear Discourse</FONT>
<P>
58. The system is thus complete. What was begun in the effort to build the
bomb - the hierarchical organization of knowledge and vision, the secrecy,
the exclusion of personal life - appears in this film in a finished form. The
depth of knowledge which is taken-for-granted has increased tremendously
from the earlier example. An audience fluent in the visual and verbal
languages of the military, and now expecting these languages to be
'realistically' employed, confronts this new constellation of significations
and discourse.
<P>
59. May we now speak of a nuclear war discourse in popular film? These films
posit a discursive position, and hence a point of view and subjectivity.
Reading them historically, we can the see the changes between two positions
in time. The changes reveal transitions in attitudes and expectations as
well as a growth in familiarity. Yet it is difficult to specify what
precisely the discourse is. <I>Above and Beyond</I> showed a hierarchy of values
which placed the system supreme; human tendencies toward caring, openness
and sharing were, in the filmic context, necessarily sacrificed. People
learned to adjust to the needs of the system. <I>By Dawn's Early Light</I>
reveals a
world where the system is in place and complete, and human values must
struggle to resist its tendencies toward autonomy and self-augmentation. The
difference between these two films cannot be explained away as a mere
transition in ideology, for to do so is to abandon the search for a nuclear
discourse in favor of politics and theoretical posturing. Rather, we must
seek to understand what has been elaborated in the intervening years.
<P>
60. The establishment of a clear narrative and signifying code revolving around
the issues of nuclear weapons systems and nuclear war posits a narrative
suspension of closure and a clearly defined act of closure which must recur
in subsequent films. Characters strive to construct the system and to
control it, making it serve their ends while the system tends always toward
exploding, toward becoming pure destructive energy. The resistance of
closure, its elliptical suspension and hence the delay of the telos, the
truth of nuclear weapons, necessarily invokes the 'human' domain which
parades before us familiar scenes in new settings: rational actors striving
to do good; lovers living their impossible romances; people just doing their
jobs, etc.
<P>
61. Yet there is critique whose appearance is the sine qua non of the
nuclear war film. Films such as <I>By Dawn's Early Light</I> almost inevitably
include some non-diegetic statement about the  danger of nuclear war.
However much we may be fascinated with the gadgetry of the system, the
planes, radars, radios, codes, plans, exotic weaponry, etc., the pleasure
derived from watching them work is a little guilty and is mollified with the
device of a critical rejoinder, much as pornographic novels would include a
'socially redeeming' paragraph at their end. Yet like pornography, the
resolution of nuclear war films drives toward a single aspect of the event.
Instead of genitals, however, we have missiles. Instead of orgasms,
explosions. The sexual dimension of nuclear weaponry is well documented
<FONT SIZE=3>(eg Cohen 1987; Easlea 1983)</FONT>, and is not the point
here. Rather, films about
nuclear weapons and nuclear war draw attention to the hardware, the
systems, the technology of nuclear war, and the mere representation of
these, their presence in the film, pressures the film toward showing their
use. We do not need to see explosions; it is enough to follow their
trajectory on the plotting boards which have supplanted reality within the
gaze the film reader now occupies. As film readers we want to see the
missiles launch, the bombs explode, the buildings shatter. The narrative
form demands as much. In pornography the orgasmic moment is called the
'money shot', the necessary end toward which each scene builds. This reveals
that pornography is organized around the gaze and pleasure of the male
viewer, the masculine event of ejaculation. Nuclear war films reveal their
positioning in the tendency toward their own money shot: the explosion. The
gaze is not human but systemic, not social but military.
<P>
62. Like pornography, nuclear war films raise the polar opposites of liberation
and power which suggest the presence of discursive center, a tendency toward
particular organizations of representation, signification and meaning.
Although, in the light of Derridian critiques we cannot locate a center,
cannot posit a 'meaning', yet we may speak of its traces. Gazing across the
military glacis, we are encouraged to take pleasure in the system and its
uses, to enjoy the spectacle of excess which plays to our own Spenglerian
expectations of decline and destruction and which expresses our own
frustration at our confinement within the system. Yet at the same time, we
are encouraged to be soothed and comforted with the control of the system
and the critique of the film itself. Our desire, having been bled off with
spectacle, is dismissed with the story we cannot quite believe, that the
nuclear war will not occur.<P>
