<tr><td><FONT SIZE=+1>34. In 1989 Romanian revolutionaries videoed their execution
of the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, and televised it "as a way of appeasing
the vengeful populace".

35. Earlier that year Lebanese terrorists sent US officials a videotape of
an American colonel who they claimed to have executed. A few frames were
shown on tv news. Military experts studied the tape to determine its
realness. And concluded the victim was dead before the hanging. It was not
the dead colonel that was meant to alarm, but the act of execution. The
death was officially faked, between countries, made fiction. As if, even at
that level something must be withheld (a real killing), or something must
be produced (a simulated execution). It is difficult to fathom what is
considered the more potent. All that is tendered, as currency, is theatre.
The colonel's story, his true life end, is denied - yet his faked death is
massively shown.
<P>
36. Execution now is (almost) invisible. It must, though, be witnessed, for
the group, and so is still staged for an audience. Executions by lethal
injection are carried out in 'chambers'. The person 'handed' a death
sentence/penalty is strapped to a stretcher: "As he spoke, saline solution
was pumped into his veins and, when he concluded, the prison warden gave
the signal for the liquid to be replaced by poison."

executed, in <I>The Advertiser,</I> Adelaide, August 4, 1994, p.

<P>
 37. Witnesses, including "four ... chosen by Drew" watched from "the
viewing position one metre away".
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
38. Outside Cummins jail, Varner, Arkansas, a group gathered to applaud
("to be in the presence of justice done to their satisfaction"), and to
protest ("liberal civil rights groups and specialist capital punishment
opponents") "the rapid-fire execution of three murderers".
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Charles Laurence, 'Hang 'em high' like the old
days, in <I>The Advertiser,</I> Adelaide, August 8, 1994, p. 13 ("They were
declared dead on Thursday by doctors whose fees for attendance were thus
cut by the economies of scale. The State congratulated itself for effiency
and saving taxpayer's money. ... This latest execution - numbers 24, 25 and
26 this year; 250, 251 and 252 since the death penalty was restored by the
Supreme Court in 1976 - has created more interest than
usual.")</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
39. Edmund Burke wrote in 1757 that the most sublime presentation of the
'imitative arts' would be abandoned by an audience if it was "reported that
a state criminal of high rank is on the point of being executed in the
adjoining square".
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Black, ibid., p. 4</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

40. "This explains," writes Joel Black, "why mime performances during the
Roman Empire incorporated actual execution scenes in which convicted
criminals took the place of actors."
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
41. The execution stops the organism signifying outside of order(ing), as
impermissable other, as the flesh of disunity, inconsistency, chaos, split,
and starts the corpse signifying inside of order(ing), giving order a
correct sheen, that cannot (though) on reflection (surface) be supported as
logic, as natural reason.
<P>
42. Still, execution is carried out by authority of highest reason (order
returned, proved): "A three-judge panel of the 8th US Circuit Court of
Appeals had earlier stayed Holmes' execution, but three hours later the
full 8th Circuit voted 8-3 to lift the stay, and the High Court declined to
issue one."
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>AP, Three killers executed one by one 'like
hogs', in <I>The Advertiser,</I> Adelaide, August 5, 1994, p.
11</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
43. The killer of order is killed, to bring torn edges together, and in so
doing tears open other edges along which all that (says) makes-up the story
of the executed circulates forever, displaying the impossibility of being,
at any instant, <I>that</I> story. The literal ending, the matter (is)
over, carried to the grave, is just the start of a bigger process
predicated on the query: tell me what really happened: ghost stories: "I
had to acknowledge that I was not capable of forming a story out of these
events. I had lost the sense of the story; that happens in a good many
illnesses. But this explanation only made them more insistent."
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Blanchot, ibid., p. 18 (It is this insistence and
consequential repetition that continually fails to fill the void, to stop
the flow, to bridge the gap. No matter how much is said, no story can every
satisfy, the said is forever another beginning.)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
44. For the Azande people (of Central Africa) all deaths were killings to
be avenged (according to Evans-Pritchard in his 1920s study).
		<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>E. E. Evans-Pritchard, <I>Witchcraft Oracles and
Magic among the Azande</I>, Clarendon Press, Oxford,
1976</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>	
<P>
45. Death was the result of witchcraft, and a man and a magician were
chosen to act as avengers, after consultation with the oracle. The avenger
had to obey strict taboos and the magician had to make poison-medicine.
"Several months after magic has been made someone dies in the vicinity and
they inquire of the poison oracle whether this man is their victim. ... In
course of time the oracle declares that the death of a man in the
neighbourhood is due to their magic and that this man is the victim whom
they have slain to avenge their kinsman."
		<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid., p. 224/225</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
46. The oracle of 'their prince' then has to agree. A public notice is
posted, and the remaining poison-medicine is destroyed: the magical task
has ended.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"When the oracle of the prince agrees with the
oracle of the kinsmen vengeance is accomplished. The wings of the fowls
that have died in acknowledgement of their victory are hung up, with the
barkcloth and sleeping-mat of the boy who has observed taboos, on a tree at
the side of a frequented path in public notification that the kinsmen have
done their duty." (ibid., p. 225)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
47. The name of the victim is kept secret by the avenging kinspeople,
otherwise "the whole procedure of vengeance would be futile".
		<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid., p. 6</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
48. A victim's death too must be avenged upon someone - that someone, the
avenging witch in the first instance, must be unknown -
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Evans-Pritchard goes into some detail as to the
complex contradictions arising from the practise of vengeance-magic, and of
the Azande being aware of them, and (for example) faking vengeance for the
benefit of neighbours. (ibid., p. 5-7, 14/15, 25-30,
124-126)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
49. unless the Prince declares "he knows Y to have died in expiation of a
crime and that his death cannot therefore be avenged".
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid., p. 6</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
50. "This is the story of my life - that is what must always be heard when
someone speaks of someone else, cites or praises him or her: '... Happy is
he who does not depart convinced that he has lived only a small part of his
life!'"
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Derrida, ibid., p. 2</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>	
<P>
51. At the limit, this is probably known, that life will have been short, a
reading of the future that is, always, as if lost. And execution is (finally
) the lawful loss of the property of oneself (excluded at last), and of the
life of oneself: my life, the right to the property of my life.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid., p. 3</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
52. And the giving of death. It can only be said that one leads one's own
life and one's own death, and death arrives early, no matter what.
Execution imposes the penalty of early death -  you are unrepeatable,
irreplaceable, this is your one death, you will not recover. You become ex
(x). "... after having wondered, in sum, why man - and not the animal -
always dies before his time, while also understanding that he dies
immaturus, immaturely and prematurely, Senaca describes the absolute
imminence, the imminence of death at every instant. This imminence of a
disappearance that is by essence premature seals the union of the possible
and the impossible, of fear and desire, and of mortality and immortality,
in being-to-death."
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid., p. 4</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
53. Barthes looks at a photograph, a portrait of Lewis Payne (by Alexander
Gardner, 1865). Payne tried to assassinate the US Secretary of State W.H.
Seward. He is photographed in his cell, waiting to be hanged. The image is
of someone who "is dead and ... is going to die ...", who is sitting,
waiting, full of <I>that</I> imminence.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Roland Barthes, <I>Camera Lucida,</I> trans.
Richard Howard, Flamingo, 1984, p. 96</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
54. And more, there is nothing to be done. His hands are barred, around
each wrist is a metal bracelet and between each bracelet a bar. His hands
are held apart, he can not wring them, they are  useless things resting on
his legs. He is already finished. Barthes calls this accord of past and
future an equivalence. In this photograph death is known by the subject,
there is no means left (over) to pretend the unity (continuity) of life, it
(testifies to) indicates what every image, real or imagined, attempts to
hide: the end.
<P>
55. Execution is a word which passes the limit (a password), the bar(s),
the barred - legality, prevention, sociability, music, award, prison,
intolerance, closure, exclusion, inclusion, exception, mark - like a sigh,
between life and death, severing. What differs, what creates the sigh, is
the time of the wait. Severing courses in the (subject's) consciousness of
the imminent instant. This is the execution's passage, there is no language
for this imminence, it is untranslatable - who would want to bear/hear it.
At the instant there is no more shelter, nothing is needed. ("They ...
argued it was unconstitutional for the State to "assess who they think is
worthy of another hour or two of life".")
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>AP, ibid.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
56. It is the possible impossible, no choice, suddenly, in the morning,
through a door, around a corner. There is nothing to say before to-say is
cut out of, sliced off, the body of the group, the limit exists for the
interminable event, for the making of the vast fatal (panic) interruption,
where the price is everything one is (now), and the world (now) too.
<P>
57. Let's believe there are only potential meanings and these are
constellations of three times: the originary moment, a repression after the
fact, and a return of the repressed. And that this constitutes the subject
of desire, of repression. And this repression desires not to know
unconscious material, the repressed. "But repression is no more consistent
than anything else. When subjects cannot fully represent something to
themselves, repression momentarily lapses."
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Ragland, ibid., p. 93</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
58. And the lapses must be filled, and by the very thing that is the
condition of an illusion, which by its pressure to reveal what it is that
isn't revealed reveals, gripped by the dream that functions like
consciousness (or vice versa), and therefore becomes central, and appears
as meaning, as substitute for what goes-missing, for what cannot be
layed-to-rest, to keep horror at bay.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid., p. 93/94</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
59. With the kill, there is no possible relationship between the self and
the corpse, or the signifier and the signifier, everything is nothing, the
space of meaning too vast to bridge, and momentarily blessed by a word, by
speech, by writing. Killing scorches the ground of discourse, all that is
said flees at the moment of saying, and is said again and again, somehow,
as terror tactic and healing balm: a vanishing point. The consistency that
execution is meant to restore is the prime myth of the practise/illusion of
reality: the execution restores the gap for which it is being
<B>exacted</B>. Death drives the life-game ("the work of our life ... is
death")
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid., p. 100</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
	
60. and taking life, for the good of the group, intensifies drive for the
game (the (love of) continuity for which the kill was ordered) which
shatters/splatters at the 'kill' instant: to live as if whole.
<P>
61. Execution is a memorial, a commemoration, to fatality, as the symbol
writ (sacrificed) real: it is done, we are implicated, we are death, and
the return (repetition, insistence, resistence) of the knowing (fallout) is
fixed (inert) - is the fix(ity). It is possible then to execute, it is
familiar: "life and death are not opposed to each other, but ... life
twines itself around many potential deaths ...".
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid., p. 99 ("We desire that which is familiar,
although it marks us as creatures of pain and insufficiency and so does not
wish our good.")</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
62. "[Mata Hari] looked straight at the twelve Zouaves who presented arms,
then readied their rifles and aimed at her body.
<P>
"She smiled, as if to acknowledge the salute. Then nodded, either to
acquiesce or order them to fire.
<P>
"The twelve shots ran out. She fell.
<P>
"Yet the firing squad had aimed badly. Only three bullets reached their
mark. But one of them went through the heart, and death was instantaneous.
<P>
"There was no need for the coup de gr&acirc;ce, but since tradition demands
it, one of the officers approached discreetly (like the cachetero who puts
the finishing touch to a bullfight) and emptied his gun into her ear. The
weapon, being an ancient model using heavy lead bullets, left a hideous
hole where her face had been."
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Erika Ostrovsky, <I>Eye of Dawn, The Rise and
Fall of Mata Hari,</I> Dorset Press, NY, 1978, p. 198/199 ("Enveloped in
the clouds of suspicion that hung over France in 1917, not one of her
former friends had the courage to claim the body and give it a decent
funeral. The remains were taken to the dissecting room of one of the Paris
municipal hospitals where her so much wanted, disputed and admired body
underwent postmortem operation in the interest of medical
science.")</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
