<tr><td><FONT SIZE=+1>"She fell heavily and motionless to the earth in front of the stake. Eleven bullets were fired and then a cavalry sergeant walked towards the body and delivered the coup de gr&acirc;ce - a final shot into her temple." (Julie Wheelwright, <I>The Fatal Lover, Mata Hari and the Myth of Women in Espionage,</I> Collins & Brown, London, 1992, p. 99)

1. Death is physical, it hardly needs saying.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"It is well known that if there is one word that
remains absolutely unassignable or unassigning with respect to its concept
and to its thingness, it is the word 'death'." (Jacques Derrida,
<I>Aporias,</I> trans. Thomas Dutoit, Stanford University Press, Stanford,
1993, p. 22)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
2. It is more than can be written or read. Everything to say, but nothing
near what 'a certain complete achievement of life' is.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Michel Foucault, Technologies of the Self, in
<I>Technologies of the Self,</I> ed. Luther H. 	Marin, et al., The
University of Massachusetts Press, Amherst, 1988, p. 31 ("This 	achievement
is complete at the moment just prior to death.")</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
3. Death is too much, and too far beyond the memory of living, of
to-be-alive, its metaphysicality fades before the sound/sight/smell of the
rifle, knife, hand. And fades and fades, while we, as watching beings, fade
with that fading, as spirit, intellect, sense, motion: stop (dead). The
body knows until its final split second.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"Excuse me if I go back to the same point: We are
thinking beings. That means that even 	when we kill or when we are killed,
even when we make war or when we ask for 	support as unemployed ... we are
thinking beings, and we do these things not only on the 	ground of
universal rules of behavior but also on the specific ground of a historical
	rationality." (ibid., p. 148)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
4. Execution is power: social, political, military, personal. It's the
deliberate making of the corpse, as the evidence, the sign, of correction,
order, force, fear.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Heinrich Himmler speaks to leaders of the SS in
Posen (4 October 1943) "without any circumlocution about the horror of
genocide: 'Most of you know what it means to see a hundred corpses lie side
by side, or five hundred or a thousand.' But then he adds: 'To have stuck
this out and excepting cases of human weakness - to have remained decent
.... this is what has made us hard.' He elaborates on this decency by
praising the virtues of SS men: their loyalty ... their ability to obey ...
their bravery ... their truthfulness ... Despite the annihilation of
millions, Himmler could assert that 'our inward being, our soul, our
character, has not suffered injury from it'." (James Bernauer, Beyond life
and death, in <I>Michel Foucault Philosopher,</I> trans. Timothy J.
Armstrong, Routledge, NY, 1992, p. 273)
	"In his memoirs, Albert Speer identified the state of mind which permitted
the 	monstrous evils our age has endured: 'It never occurred to us to doubt
the order of 	things.'"(ibid., p. 274)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
5. The corpse is a return to, and of, like the repressed, that which is
(appears) inadmissable.
<P>
6. Execution is the excess which deals with excess. It makes the space
where emptiness must be, and where forever after, in that hole, a haunting
gathers, a ritual repetition of the fragment and the unfinished, of the
bringing to and taking away, a rhythm, of the cut which narrates the
endless stories that 'become' the ghost. The ghost is the speech, the
writing, the sentence, of the executed, who come to be dead for the sake of
the live.
<P>
7. There are several photographic images which shock me. They show an
execution by torture, on April 10 1905, in Peking. The imperial decree
read: "'The Mongolian Princes demand that the aforesaid Fou-Tchou-Le,
guilty of the murder of Prince Ao-Han-Ouan, be burned alive, but the
Emperor finds this torture too cruel and condemns Fou-Tchou-Li to slow
death by <I>Leng-Tch-e </I>(cutting into pieces). Respect this!' This
torture dates from the Manchu dynasty (1644-1911)."
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Georges Bataille, <I>The Tears of Eros,</I>
trans. Peter Connor, City Lights Books, San 	Francisco, 1989, p.
204</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>8. Bataille thought the man had been given opium, which might
explain his "ecstatic ... expression".
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid., p. 205: Bataille was given one of these
images by the French psychoanalyst Dr 	Borel in 1925: "This photograph had
a decisive role in my life. I have never stopped 	being obsessed by this
image of pain, at once ecstatic (?) and intolerable. I wonder 	what the
Marquis de Sade would have thought of this image, Sade who dreamed of
	torture, which was inaccessible to him, but who never witnessed an actual
torture 	session." (ibid., p. 206)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
9. The torture is called, writes Bataille, the <I>Hundred Pieces,</I>
"reserved for the gravest of crimes".
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
10. The images are an intolerable-knowledge.
<P>
11. The narratives which come to fill the void (life taken by 'law', from
criminal law to gang law) are themselves threads of the death drive,
language re-presentations of the vanished body/person. They are never
enough. It, the void, is interminable, inconsolable. Fire. Language can not
be the thing, just shimmer on the surface, the residual impact of meaning
lost.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"Every culture is characterized by its way of
apprehending, dealing with, and, one 	could say, 'living' death as
trespass. Every culture has its own funerary rites, its 	representations of
the dying, its ways of mourning or burying, and its own evaluation 	of the
price of existence, of collective as well as individual life." (Derrida,
ibid., p. 	24)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
12. "In Lacanian theory, seeing, being, talking, thinking, reading,
writing, feeling, and perceiving are all organized in networks of meaning
and affect around a hole or void that pierces through the weave of
introjected representations."
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Ellie Ragland, Lacan, the Death Drive, and the
Dream of the Burning Child, in <I>Death 	and Representation,</I> ed. Sarah
Webster Goodwin & Elisabeth Bronfen, The Johns 	Hopkins University Press,
Baltimore and London, 1993, p. 81</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
13. Death comes always to everyone, execution (as decree) comes to few.
There are slow and sudden and expected deaths. And execution can be all of
these at once. It is, though, always, somehow, untimely. Out of time, time
taken out, to be the time of dying, the end of 'you', who you 'are', in the
fact of 'being' at all, and in the fact of not being 'something/one-else':
early morning, before the complete arrival of the new day(light): "... at
3am Massard, the representative of the military governor of Paris, was
woken by a phone call announcing that Margaretha Geertruida Zelle, known as
Mata Hari, would be shot at 5.45am that morning."
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Wheelwright, p. 96</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
14. At the moment of death, the person is all that they will ever be, in
the real.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"By its very essence, death is in every case
mine, insofar as it 'is' at all ... " (Derrida, 	ibid., p.
26)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
15. The haunting which gathers at, which meets, the death by execution is
aware of that, and of the rest, now a future memory, of what might have
been, imagined. Psyche works forward, drawing from life yet unlived, as
part of the 'living' present, as much as from the past, to be the comprised 
subject at any moment, to be 'is'.
<P>
16. "Ah, this flash of instants never ends. Will my song of the <I>it</I>
never end? I'm going to end it deliberately, with a voluntary act. But it
continues on in constant improvisation, creating always and forever the
present which is the future.
<P>
"This improvisation <I>is</I>.
<P>
"Do you want to see how it continues on?
<P>
"Tonight - it's difficult to explain it to you - tonight I dreamed I was
dreaming. Is it possible that death is like that? - the dream of a dream of
a dream of a dream?"
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Clarice Lispector, <I>The Stream of Life,</I>
trans. Elizabeth Lowe & Earl Fitz, University of 	Minnesota Press,
Minneapolis, 1989, p. 78 ("The now is and is not what it is. More
	precisely, it only 'scarcely' ... is what it is. Insofar as it has been,
it no longer is. But 	insofar as it will be, as future to come or as death
.... it is not yet." Derrida, ibid., p. 	14)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
17. Does one long to be killed, glimpsed in longing for end, for
fitting-death, to the day, to the season, to the heat, to the work. Is
there a dream of execution without fear.
<P>
18. Execution is <I>about</I> the act of dying, the act of killing, of
being killed, it is <I>only</I> about knowing of the about-to-die. This is
its exact purpose, the penalty of limit, to be there before (facing) the
'sword', taking last breaths, feeling heart beats, while so-very-alive,
probably well, strong, and with all of memory and thought in focus and
imminent.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"It is strange that people very rarely faint
during those final seconds. On the contrary, 	the brain is terribly alive
and active; it must be racing, racing, racing like a machine 	at full
speed. Imagine how many thoughts must be throbbing together, all
unfinished, 	some of them may be irrelevant and absurd: That man staring -
has a wart on his forehead, and, here, one of the executioner's buttons has
rusted. And at the same time 	he knows everything ... there is one point
that cannot be forgotten, and he cannot faint, 	and everything turns around
it, around that point. And to think that it must be like this 	up to the
last quarter second, when his head is already on the block, and waits, and
-	knows, and suddenly he hears the iron slithering down above his head ..."
	(Dostoyevsky, quoted in Robert Johnson, <I>Condemned to Die, Life Under
Sentence of 	Death,</I> Elsevier North Holland, Inc., NY, 1981, p.
98)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
19. The (w)hole is left, where nothing is ever 'once and for all', where an
economy of relations, a sort of proliferating forum of broken promises, of
processes and struggles, perpetually seeks the real true story of the real
true person, to close the case, to bound the carcass. But there is no
bridging the gap here, of signifier to signifier, of signification. The
rules of execution are determined by courts. This is, perhaps, the bigger
trauma, and where the drawing together of edges, as a mechanism, a
technique, might be itself a body, constituted in the (ir)rational setting
up of language structures to formulate reasons to kill. A body (politic)
which needs other bodies for its rituals.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"One would be concerned with the 'body politic',
as a set of material elements and 	techniques that serve as weapons,
relays, communication routes and supports for the 	power and knowledge
relations that invest human bodies and subjugate them by turning 	them into
objects of knowledge." (Foucault, p. 28)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
20. Here the lines of power are written, the death drive falls into the
open, as a matter of 'culling', known as punishment, discipline,
retribution, alignment. Just like, in the individual psyche, the remainders
of events, losses, are marks, knots of unassimilated meanings, made (up) by
an inability or refusal to 'understand' what might be 'the personal
devaluation implicit in them'.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Ragland,  p. 82</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
21. And so ... "(a)s untranslated remainders, such knotty material becomes
parasitical archaic letters that constitute death <I>material.</I> These
letters (Lacan plays on <I>l'&ecirc;tre</I> as the letter of being)
maintain a power of death over life because and <I>simply</I> because they
are present - embedded in flesh, in-corp-orated, repeated in behaviour and
myth - but are inaccessible to reflection, contemplation, or undoing."
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid., p. 82/83</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
22. What happens when there are knots of unassimilated meanings in the
world beyond the body, that engage with the knots of the body, and not only
that but with combinations of bodies, of groups, and conditions, and times
- like war. What is it that speaks (and explains), both inside, to the
world of oneself, and outside, to the world of others, and re-collects and
re-produces, and de-tours from, the death (of someone). The constellation
of knots - of stop and go, in-the-name-of-love (ourselves, life) - insures,
underwrites, by maintaining tense psychic energy, the (a)parallel contrary
movements of sameness and difference, of an ever present belatedness.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>See Elisabeth Bronfen, Risky Resemblances: On
Repetition, Mourning, and 	Representation, in <I>Death and
Representation,</I> ibid., p. 103-129</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
23. What is an execution. The word comes from the latin <I>exsequi,</I>
meaning to follow (in sequence, consequence) <I>ex</I> or out, i.e. to the
end, to the grave, and from (via late latin derivatives)
<I>exsec&uuml;tio,</I> judicial prosecution or sentence, and from the
feminine word <I>exsec&uuml;trix,</I> one who carries out a task (the
guillotine was known as la guillotine or Dame Guillotine).
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>The guillotine was the brain<I>child</I> of Dr
Guillotin. "Messieurs, with my machine I 	can whisk off your heads in the
twinkling of an eyelid. You won't feel a thing." He said 	to the French
Assembly in December 1789. (Camille Naish, <I>Death Comes to the 	Maiden,
Sex and Execution 1431-1933,</I> Routledge, London & NY, 1991, p. 104) It
	came to be thought of as Guillotin's daughter. Sexed feminine through
language, 	machine being feminine in French, and via birth, it soon became
'woman'. "Aided no 	doubt by features of design, such as the victim lying
on his stomach with his head in the 	lunette, popular humour did not
hesitate to compare loss of the capital member with 	that of another part.
The guillotine inherited from the gallows the nickname of 'La 	Veuve', the
Widow.' (ibid., p. 106) The Scottish beheading machine was called the
	Maiden. "The last man to die by the Maiden, the earl of Argyle in 1685,
declared 'as he 	pressed his lips on the block, that it was the sweetest
maiden he had ever kissed' .... 	Behind 'la veuve,' who has consummated her
affair, and 'the Maiden,' who sheds her 	first blood, is the guillotine as
a gaping, single-toothed vagina dentata." (Regina Janes, 	Beheadings, in
<I>Death and Representation,</I> p. 255) "The guillotine became the subject
	of jokes and songs, and a significant proportion of them celebrated it 'as
a gruesome 	<I>femme fatale'."</I> (Naish, p. 106)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
24. Execution, then, is a sentence, a prosecution, followed, carried, 'to
the grave', sanctioned by the law of any arranged system or order. The
feminine, announced through the suffix 'trix', a feminine agential, is
possibly an abbreviation of the suffix <I>torix</I> (a compound of
male/female), as the true f 'answer' to (L) - or is (L) -rix.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Eric Partridge, <I>Origins, A Short Etymological
Dictionary of Modern English,</I> 	Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1982, p.
864</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
25. So, let it be that the execution is a doubly gendered agent/carrier of
the law (not forgetting that the law is 'her').
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"What's more, the law absurdly credited me with
all powers; she declared herself 	perpetually on her knees before me."
(Maurice Blanchot, <I>The Madness of the Day,</I> 	trans. Lydia Davis,
Station Hill Press, NY, 1981, p. 15)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
26. This is curious, as it places the onus onto the order, not onto those
who <I>order</I>, or that which <I>orders</I>, or the 'one' who executes
the <I>order</I>, the sentence. Execution is the burden of the
(hermaphroditic) group. Hence, the executioner is anonymous at the public
(there are always witnesses) site: torture, hanging, beheading, bullet,
electric chair, lethal injection.
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>The firing squad share the killing. No-one knows
whose bullet is fatal. And a blank is 	usually issued, so there is the
'fact' that any one of the squad can not kill. The shared 	responsibility
and the total absolution are integral to the ritual or machine which
executes.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
27. The question, continuous, to the grave, of the semantic form of the
execution, of fascination, which produces images of death in speech and
writing, giving voice to violence, in all its subtle and gross aesthetics,
is nothing more, and as much as, a means of confirmation that death is far
off, separate: how did the victim 'look', how was the act carried out, the
details, the fine precise knowledge which allows one to quote, as a gift,
to repeat, to join the conversation, to compensate for the non-spectacle,
and to somehow honour the inevitable.
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"If we may be permitted to give our opinion,
such sights are frightfully painful. The 	blood flows from the blood
vessels at the speed of the severed carotids, then it 	coagulates. The
muscles contract and their fibrillation is stupefying; the intestines
	ripple and the heart moves irregularly, incompletely, fascinatingly. The
mouth 	puckers at certain moments in a terrible pout. It is true that in
that severed head the 	eyes are motionless with dilated pupils; fortunately
they look at nothing and, if they 	are devoid of the cloudiness and
opalescence of the corpse, they have no motion; their 	transparence belongs
to life, but their fixity belongs to death. All this can last minutes,
	even hours, in sound specimens: death is not immediate ... Thus, every
vital element 	survives decapitation." (Medical report quoted in Albert
Camus, <I>Reflections on the 	Guillotine,</I> trans. Richard Howard,
Fridtjof-Karla Publications, Michigan City, 1960,	p.
12)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

28. Execution has a history as long as defeat, victory, pleasure, pain:
death exercised (exacted) by the technology of power: "By the period of the
[French] Revolution, the display of severed heads had long been one of the
commonest ways a European sovereign demonstrated his power to his subjects.
As part of his responsibility to control public violence, he reserved to
himself and his officials the right to take and to display heads. ... When
the sovereign displays a head, he shows it not to his equals but to his
people. They are the objects of that display, both as raw material and as
audience. Their heads are the heads that are elevated, and it is they who
must learn the lesson taught by them."
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Janes, p. 245</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

29. All deaths are killings: death <I>by</I> disease, <I>by</I> accident,
<I>by</I> age, etc. "Lacan came to see death in drives or discrete bodies
of meaning that control our destinies and write upon our bodies qua
organisms."
	  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>Ragland, p. 83</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
30. Death is, according to Lacan, more than a fact of life, more than our
'self'. Its 'effects' emanate from loss too intimate to name, around which
swirl love of pain, obsession, belief: symptom. Death is opaque. It is, as
symptom, "a structural imaginary that dwells alongside the ego".
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>ibid.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
31. It anchors us to the pleasures of our desire, it closes us against what
the ego reads as 'more' loss. It becomes the 'voice' in language, it marks
language by arranging sound/tone via speech and writing. Death is language
work. The subject of execution is always in-the-know. On death row for
months or years.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"PRISONER: How am I going to approach and sit in
that chair? How am I going to take it? What's it going to be like? How is
it going to feel? I already have an understanding about electricity, you
know; it's not hard for me to imagine what an experience it would be.
<br>
	INTERVIEWER: I see. It's a very ugly-sounding experience.
<br>
	PRISONER: Definitely. Just think about the insides of your body, you know,
how such 	organs could be burned, you know, thousands of high voltage.
Think about the precious 	brain that is in your head, you know? Think about
your eyes? What will become of 	them through such hundreds of volts being
ran through your body? It's just really 	unpredictable what all can happen
through such an experience, and what it will be like 	to go through it, to
die right there, strapped in the chair." (Johnson, p.
85/86)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
32. Before the barrel for a second. An execution <I>is exacted</I> upon the
consciousness of the person, they know, that is. Perhaps many murders are
executions, and many suicides. The assassination though is out-of-the-blue.
Kennedy did not see the rifle, or hear the shot. The assassin is hidden.
The executioner is not.
	<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>What the assassination is, is not clear: see
paragraphs 2 and 18.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
33. An execution is an exercise of executive power. The executive must
execute the body, and the icon that that body embodies, the psyche. The
executive can change (hands): "When the rabble cut off the heads of the
king's officers, they have redefined themselves as the sovereign people.
Literally and physically, they have seized the ultimate power of the
sovereign. Instead of learning, they teach. It is a disturbing lesson to
those identified with the old order; it is an invigorating lesson to those
who identify with the new. As for those identified with the old order who
believe they identify with the new, they ignore the lesson or palliate it."
