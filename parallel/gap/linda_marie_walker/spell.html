I put a spell on you<br>
because you're mine<br>
you better stop the things you do<br>
you know I can't stand it<br>
your running around<br>

The very first line: "Everything in the world began with a yes."<A HREF="#note1">(1)</a> "... the way smoke remains in the air after a bridge is burned ..."<A HREF="#note">(2)</a> On purpose. Too late. The words are said, out loud. Like wish, for death. A little sacrifice. Who knows, things might be better. "When someone says 'drop dead' in a Weldon novel, we start searching for the body."<A HREF="#note3">(3)</a> To think those two perfect words, as curse, to be delivered. Drop dead. And to think too: don't think that, it might come true. No way of knowing. That's for sure. Small small words, scarcely there, but sound. Bells, tinkling in the breeze, from the heart, so sad. That has been broken. Meanwhile: the body is parted, from the damned, or so it thinks. The curse has begun.<p> 

<b>ye</b><br> 
Nothing to see, or hear, on the surface. And is too rich, rich to beyond, at the very moment of entry, ongoing. The folds of the wound are ground, & mute is to cruel, what hope is to pause. Who carries you off, this is the question. Who wants you dead. What is wished, is wished. Requires time, minute work.
<p>

"Seeing before vision, seeing to see and see, before the eyes' narrative ­ this is not sorcery. It is the science of the other! An art in itself; and all the ways of letting all the beings with their different strangenesses enter our proximity are regions that ask to be approached, each with an appropriate patience. There is a patience for the egg, a patience for a rose; a patience for each particular animal; there is a patience for species, all kinds of patiences, to practice, to develop ..."<A HREF="#note4">(4)</a> 
<p>
<b>w&egrave</b><br>
"There must be a wait long enough to save the ant ... There must be a wait so powerfully thoughtful, open, toward beings so close, womanly-familiar that they are forgotten for it, so that the day will come in which the women who have always been ­ there, will at last appear."<A HREF="#note5">(5)</a>

<b>ga</b><br>
The words used in chants, from the hiss of the snake, the bell-snake, the musical wood, to 'swim' in grace (beat).
<p>
<b>zo</b><br>
They (they) walk on the point, and the point is everywhere, everything.
<p>
<b>ba</b><br>
Madame Carlotta's favourite colour is rose, and she enjoys blue, white, or cream drinks, sweet water, all kinds of non-alcoholic liqueurs, although she never refuses a glass of clairin. She loves acassan: boiled cornmeal with cane juice. She prefers the meat of young tender chickens as an offering. She works only for those who take her fancy. How would this look drawn on the floor in charcoal or cordite or beachsand.
<p>
<b>tu</b><br>
You must bring flowers to the dead, they need them to soothe lingering fear. It wants deliverance, follow the score on the water.
<p>

Not simply for vanity's sake: &eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;&eacute;. And proceed to travel on it (the surface) just as ships do. A lick of the ground. Then a lie down, lie a moment, on your side, get to your feet, you help you to your feet, by yourself.
<p>
<b>de</b><br>
Every writing has its rhythm to which its chant is sung. Such is the difference, and economy, of damp, say, or salt. Magic is accorded with words. Promise(s).
<p>
<b>vi</b><br>
The ingredients for a 'charm' lamp are: half a coconut shell, a magnet, syrup, sugar, honey, perfume, flower petals (jasmine and heliotrope), a sheep's brain, & olive oil. Keep it burning until done.
<p>
<b>ka</b><br>
Prayers are (always) about to start. The dancing has stopped. A mass of white dresses ... The ceremony over, dawn. Thank goodness. Again.

Macab&eacute;a: Am I a monster or is this what it means to be a person.
<p>
<b>ya</b><br>
Macab&eacute;a consults Madame Carlota "who has the power to break any spells that might be worrying her clients".<A HREF="#note6">(6)</a> (Lispector writes: Facts are words expressed throughout the world. Well then.)
<p>
<b>ou</b><br>
Macab&eacute;a takes a taxi, her first. Finds Madame Carlota easily, a favourable omen she thinks. She is greeted warmly. There are plastic flowers. "Plastic was the last word in luxury." Carlota is made-up, like a china-doll. She says, "I'm a fan of Jesus. I'm just mad about him." She tells Macab&eacute;a about her days as a prostitute, etc. Finally she reads M's cards. And there is only misery. "Macab&eacute;a turns pale: it had never occurred to her that her life was so awful." But then, Carlota changes her tune and tells M wonderful things. Her life will change, work, fortune, love, a fur coat. And Carlota tells M about her last client "who was going to be knocked down on the road". M is drunk with joy, already in-love. And so M leaves - in search of her destiny. Transformed by words, a new person. She steps off the pavement to cross the road. "And a yellow Mercedes, as huge as an ocean liner, knocked her down." She lives for a little while in the gutter, then: "Macab&eacute;a is dead". Finishing the book Lispector writes: "Don't forget, in the meantime, that this is the season for strawberries. Yes."<A HREF="#note7">(7)</a> End: yes.
<p>
<b>fa</b><br>
To pass through all the registers, to the fantastically true, is stilling an acting, in telling it, in plotting it: to remember something, returned; a resistant heroine: bless the hysteric who knew/knows how to escape him (from it, which is what, a blade of grass: "Macab&eacute;a lay helpless by the side of the road. She felt drained of all emotion as she looked at the stones around the sewer and sprouting blades of wild grass; their greenness conveyed the most tender hope."<A HREF="#note8">(8)</a>) ... 

<p>
<b>ye</b><br>
E(nd), &eacute;, long live, all that, & seduction, & flirting with demons, to see, the condition of obeah/fetish.

<p>
<b>da</b><br>da
The fetish was a useful thing, or a thing anyway, prized, not offered for sale to the invaders, small, artful, made by the person, treasured. Kept on the body. Some fetishes are/were dolls, stones, teeth, claws, bones. They are worn to impart magical powers: protection, luck, love, cure, money, or curse. The <A HREF=http://www.va.com.au/parallel/x2/journal/lmw/index.html>fetish</a> is sacred, honoured.

<p>
<b>w&egrave</b><br>
Fetish may derive from the latin 'factitius': made by art. Or from the portuguese 'feitico': charm.

<p>
<b>ga</b><br>
The early traders (to Africa, to the Caribbean) thought the sacred objects were playthings. The colonisers forbade their slaves their religion, threatened torture or death. "Any slave found possssing a fetish was to be imprisoned, hanged, or flayed alive."<A HREF="#note9">(9)</a> Now, sometime: declare/own a fetish.

<p>
<b>zo</b><br>
The fetish needs care: a leather pouch or a jar, and food. Take the fetish to heart, it's the future. The dark red petals of the sweet-pea, the orange pink of the tulip, are signs. The fetish seeks audience, the invention invites spectator. This is procedure, perhaps, the occasion of elaboration. Setting in motion this tiring pleasure ("Over time, the character G. H. came to give me, for example, a very difficult pleasure; but it is called pleasure."<A HREF="#note10">(10)</a>) A prickling, millions of creatures in (side) the skin, a horrible kiss. 
 
<p>
<b>ba</b><br>
In the interim: secret gatherings in the street. Someone looking. And recalling. And someone else. And on & on. To tell, to flee. It's the same. And all the relations. To soft bones. To come (it comes) out. Something/one is emerging between speaking and walking. It will come out it will. The sorceress sheds tears (two), to mark.

<p>
<b>de</b><br>
"I am a woman of the past century," says Emmy von N ..."<A HREF="#note11">(11)</a>

<p>
<b>vi</b><br>
When grace occurred: 2.55pm, five minutes earlier than expected, deeply moving, the beat continued, & she, the women, fell asleep. The celebration gone for the moment: she will never settle down.

<p>
<b>ka</b><br>
"... music at a different tempo signifying the break with the tempo of work ..."<A HREF="#note12">(12)</a> And have smoke blown in your face. And have your face hidden by smoke. And breathe smoke. And smoke. 

<p>
<b>fu</b><br>
"... and preferring speech reduced to practically nothing ..."<A HREF="#note13">(13)</a> Of smoke. Of whatever is good for nothing.

<p>
<b>ya</b><br>
The smoke has come away from a body, as waste. As bit of body, as contagion. From a hole, emitted, changed. Is given, smoke, in place of that refused: to cry, to shed. To show through tears: love, guilt, truth. Waste spreads across the eyes, circulates, the smoked body is relieved of grief. The burnt smell, warm from the other, imbued by her/his insides/smells, breaks the spell, of the bound, and casts another. One is the other. That is writing, as thing, suspended, in space, and moving, passing through zones. Every letter necessary. Or not. "What troubles her is writing."<A HREF="#note14">(14)</a> Oh, this is so threadbare. You will not wear it, it's o or x. It will not be something. Slowing right down, now sitting. And taking oneself for something, even for someone. A person. Star. The not me, the same. Smoke, something like dust, ash, but not, useless, very little to see, & in your eyes, unbearable. Grey matter(s).

To be continued ... as constellation.
