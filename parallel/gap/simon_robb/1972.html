There was a big fight on the Oval one day. the Boys from my grade were
involved. A teacher made all the boys go in one class room and the girls in
the other because he wanted to talk to the boys about something. He wanted
to know who was in the fight. Somehow some boys ended up standing at the
front  and I was one of them. Then he made us confess. It was like a little
death, I remember thinking, and how scary it would be to think that you
were going to be killed. 
<P>


When 1972 is remembered it is often in these terms 'I remember that I was
doing...' or  'I was ....in 1972'. So some of these things really happened
in 1972 and that's what the 'I' (the autobiographical I) signifies. At
least that's the generic convention of reading 'I'; linking the subject of
the text and the speaking subject. For example: 'I am inside the Duncan
death. I have no idea why 'I' is inside this event'. But there  it is. <P>





Supreme Court jury was told yesterday to 'walk back in time' to understand
SA's 1972  attitudes... Crown Prosecutor Mr P. Rice, QC, suggested the
'time warp' because attitudes had changed since the 
death of homosexual law lecturer Dr George Duncan <I>Advertiser</I>   Sep.
14 1988:1. <P>


I  was doing a social studies project about Captain Charles Sturt. The
lesson was about how he sailed up the Murray River and was speared by some 
aborigines. I remember feeling afraid looking at the picture of him being
speared. It seemed that he was all alone and there as no one around to stop
it happening. In the picture he is falling backwards towards the river and
is going to die. <P>

  Doom struck and fearful, of individuals and  institutions, this subject
is suspicious of hidden meanings and entrapment.The fear that'I' is doomed
to be killed is the fear of the suicide and  the abjected subject.  It is
fearful of an uncanny reversal. The uncanny strikes when what was
apparently familiar becomes unfamiliar. It strikes rapidly, out of the
dark, and from the light. <P>

Dr George Duncan ...drowned on the night of May 10, 1972, after a group of
men threw him into the Torrens [river]...Duncan, a homosexual ...was killed
less than a kilometre from  <A HREF =
"http://www.wombat.com.au/wombat/tour/sa/photo/adelaide.html">the city</A>
centre. By day, this stretch of the river is idyllic; families picnic and
hire paddleboats. By night it is a well known homosexual 'beat'. Police
involvement in the killing was widely suspected....police often threw
homosexuals into the river for 'fun'. In 1986, three former vice squad
officers were charged with Duncan's manslaughter. The case against one was
dismissed: the other two were acquitted. (Cadzow 13). 
<P>

Dunking is holding someone under water.  In 1972  we used to dunk our
friends. We did this by pushing someones head under the water and holding
it there for at least a while. They had been dunked then. So we were
dunking each other in summer at the pool . Dunking was a way of
demonstrating superiority.   Often  under water you might feel the fear of
drowning, or the desire to be drowned. <P>



I feel that treatment of homosexuality, if you feel it should be treated,
is rather like the psychological and psychiatric treatment of suicide in
our society: we can help individuals quite a lot if they want treatment,
but we can't make any significant change to the overall incidence of the
problem in society  (Tottman 32).<P>


The  phrase 'should be dead' can be  articulated  over a range of
discursive sites: personal; political; sexual; popular; expert. These
articulations take the generic form of autobiography, print journalism,
poetry,  commentary and criticism,  historical narrative and  institutional
rhetoric. They are mixed up with fluids and violence and a drowning. 
<P>


Now I remember:<BR>
        Sturt had already noted the exceptionally strong currents at this spot,
but nevertheless Barker stripped off, and when Kent had fixed the compass
securely around his forehead he dived in....after Barker had landed, he
continued on for some distance to the second large dune from which he was
probably intending to take his bearings. From someway off, however, three
natives had watched him approach and were particularly puzzled and
frightened by the compass. Realising this, Barker tried to reassure them;
but as they closed in on him with their spears he retreated towards the sea
and was at the water's edge when the first spear hit him in the side. This
did not stop him, and he was already among the breakers when the second
struck him in the shoulder.  With this he turned round to face the natives,
but the third spear must already have been in flight, for, as he did, so,
it plunged deep into his chest. The blacks dragged him from the water,
retrieved their weapons and completely mutilated his body before throwing
it back into the sea, where it was carried away by the tide (Langley
100-101). <P>



The subject is named  by being tagged or branded on its surface creating  a
particular kind of 'depth-body' or interiority, a physic layer the subject
identifies as its (disembodied) core. Subjects thus produced are not simply
the imposed results of  alien,  coercive forces; the body is internally
lived, experienced and acted upon by the subject and the social
collectivity . . . the subject is marked as a series of (potential)
messages from/of the (social) Other . . . . (Grosz 65).<P>

There may be  something camp and erotic about this body.
Camp if we focus on the body as an aesthetic pose, a pose of triffling and
exaggerated gestures, of penetration and succumbing. Think about the
plasticity of an early nineteenth century mourning. Sentiment and excess
rule over PC  politics in camp. As for erotic, it's the kind of erotica we
might find in Christian iconography (<A HREF =
"http://www.parnasse.com/stsebast.jpg">St Sebastian</A>) where sublime
pleasure (union with God) is coupled with extreme and prolonged pain. So
here we are entering into the erotics of masochism, and the pleasure of
identifying with the victim of a  sublime death.  <P>


The Bishop of Adelaide now stated that he would not object to a relaxing of
the laws on homosexuality. 'While I condemn the sin, I am extremely sorry
for these unfortunate people. I don't think they should be put in prison
and I think the law should be such that it protects them from being exposed
to the possibility of blackmail'  (quoted in Reeves 24). <P>

Sorrow and compassion  rise to fever pitch when an abjected other  begins
to return, like a prodigal son. Begins to return because he must for the
city good. He's someone we remember. Who is really one of us. Who has
rights too. Because we are so enlightened. <P>



If Forster could not be frank about the pain of homosexual love, as Proust
and Gide were, he could have learned from the superb example of <I>Death in
Venice</I>, published in 1912, the year before he began  Maurice.  There is
a paragraph in Maurice  (and it is not enough) where the hero responds to a
lascivious sign from an aged homosexual and then knocks him down, and he
'saw in this disgusting and dishonourable old age his own.' This is
thematically similar to the scene when von Aschenbach is revolted by an old
invert  on the boat to Venice, and ironically, becomes very like him by the
end of the novella. Mann portrays von Aschenbach's physical yearning for
Tadzio ambiguously and suggests that a homosexual love, modelled on
<I>Hellenic</I>  idealism, can be a nourishing as well as a destructive
passion (Meyers 61).<P>

He told the police he had been sitting on a  bench when another man, Dr.
Duncan, had been thrown into the river by a group of young men. He said he
did not know Dr. Duncan and that the same men who had thrown the lecturer
into the river also threw him in. <I>Advertiser</I>  13 May 1972: 13.<P>

In cross-examination, he said that while the family had not had any 'in
depth' conversations about homosexuality, he had no doubts that [his son]
was against it. 'I can remember us walking across the University Bridge
once and telling him about the Duncan Drowning. And I can remember telling
him that people have rights which should not be intruded upon. He never
argued back against me'.   <I>Advertiser</I>   7  April 1990: 1<P>

What is this? It's nothing. It's empty. It's a picnic in the sun with
friends and family. It is a wholesome swim in the sea. It's kindness and
friendship and laughter. It is a beautiful day. This is easy to write
because it is so apposite. <P>


I turned around to see just where he was, but there was just the top of his
head and two of his hands above the water. He was just opening and closing
his hands. I remember being amazed because I always assumed someone
drowning would splash, yell and panic, but he just slipped away and it was
like he was never there  (Hunt  144).<P>

'Should be dead' is a terrifying phrase. Especially when spoken in the
corridors of power. It prompts a consideration of  the rational deployment
of  power.  It is an utterance that makes violence possible. The 'should'
means that it would happen if it were possible. It is an utterance that
motivates both covert and overt acts of injustice. (Both of which are
features of this textual field) . It allows  conspiratorial acts to
flourish in the dark and within an enlightened city.  'Should be dead' is a
phrase that is articulated in Church rhetoric, the actions of the killers
(alleged  cops), in the father talking to his son, and the psychiatrist
making an analogy between suicide and homosexuality.  Better off hidden,
out of the way, underwater: dead. These are institutional but also personal
articulations of the phrase 'should be dead', or, 'has no right to live'.
<P>


He said that he had called out to those on the bank that a man was
drowning. He had scrambled back up the bank. The group had returned and one
of them had pushed him back in saying: 'Go save your mate!' (Hunt  144).<P>

<CENTER>But the person who can see these phenomena<BR>
As normal and meaningless, can detach,<BR>
And will not suffer.<BR>
Whatever happens to him, he will not suffer.<BR>
In spite of difficulties, he can smile and be calm<BR>
 (Phra Ajahn 34).
</CENTER><P>

Sorrow and compassion  wane when the good son turns bad. When he's so rank
and rotten he needs to be expelled. Like the colonial explorer. Who should
be murdered. Dumped out of sight. Who did not ever have a right.  For whom
there is no tear or beating heart. Because we are so postcolonial. <P>


In 1972 I was at school in grade six.  I used to put on puppet shows for my
class with some friends. We would make the puppets and the show was usually
violent with some death. And laughs. We put on a play about Ancient  Greece
or Rome.  People died and were poisoned and stabbed.A soldier would return
from the colonies in Thrace. Emperors ate Malteesers.<P>

<CENTER>A moving pathos:<BR>
 Barker to Duncan; <BR>
colonial to<BR>
 postcolonial martyr.</CENTER> <P>


When 'should be dead' is sanctioned by friends and  family  there is little
  space for sorrow and compassion. Below the water-line and operating below
the threshold of consciousness.  The subject who 'should be dead' will  be
found in whatever causes disturbance to order. Whatever needs to be
expunged in order for the system to remain stable. <P>


As I fell there was  loneliness and fear and fear of death. It is darkness
and isolation. It is polluted water, poison, sour milk. Gagging. Bad water
and the body inside of all that. It's a bad birth remembered. A bad birth 
hung on to for too long. In a medical chamber. The darkness and the
drowning and the lights of an exploding life.<P>

<CENTER>Murder is an eyeball pressed up against an arsehole<BR>
an eyeball is an arsehole that never opens<BR>
an arsehole is an eyeball that never blinks<BR> (Smith).
</CENTER><P>


The murder of a respectable university  law lecturer provoked horror in the
wider community, bringing into question the role and reputation of the
Police Force and the legal discrimination of homosexual acts. For the
State's gays and lesbians, Duncan has come to represent much more over the
last twenty years. His death is seen as the galvanising force behind law
reform and he has become a symbol of the persecution and maltreatment of a
misunderstood minority group by an ignorant, intolerant and hostile society
(Reeves 10-11). <P>


There was also a record that I put on once in 1972 which I think was <I>The
Right of Spring</I> ? It has a cover which scared me. (The doomed to die
fear again). It was blue green watery background and there was a  man
dancing and he had  the head of a horse, or was it a goat? He  had huge
horns and he had something in his  outstretched hands. Branches. Thin, like
small trees.<P>

 
        
It might not be unusual for a State that would be swept along by the
Dunstan social reform  package to take the lead in decriminalising
homosexual acts. But the first Bill was...simply a rash and empty
libertarian gesture fuelled by community concern over an appalling and
senseless murder. It was not introduced to bring homosexuals into parity
with heterosexuals within the wider community. It was aimed at reducing
blackmail, keeping the police force out of decoy activities and allowing
homosexuals to seek 'treatment'. Most importantly, it ensured that
homosexuality was removed to the private sphere and out of the public eye
(Reeves  67).<P>
