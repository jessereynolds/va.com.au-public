Two women check into a hotel. At 5 am.<br> 
The street is slow. They drink champagne. At dawn one of them will depart. Her children will be awake.<br>
She does not consider the past. Much.<br>
She phones long distance. Reverses the charge. Angst is not on her agenda.<br>
She goes to the studio at midnight. During a hail storm. Works & sleeps till dawn. She is obsessed. The story is indefinite. She quotes herself. Writes herself writing. Constructs herself as lover. She puts the flowers in her room.<br>
She imagines herself in love. For a moment. She thinks of the Mauritian.<br>
She measures computer text blocks.<br>
At first light the city is washed & hung out to dry.<br>
She hooks into a global information circuit. Dips her fingers in a bowl of pureed fruit. <br>
Sucks.<br>
Atlantic City is cold. But sunny. Life will be peaches & cream. <br>
Her lover plays craps. Wins. Always.<br>
Do you want me to tell you the story.<br>
No. Never.<br>
Subject to the gaze of the camera the body became the object of closest scrutiny, its surface continually examined for the signs of innate physical, mental & moral inferiority. From this science of corporeal semiotics there emerged new forms of knowledge about the individual & new ways of mapping depravity.<br>
Two women exchange black sweaters. In the toilet. On a train. One of them smells of perfume. One of them smells of skin. One of them pulls on a pair of black leather gloves. 
She has no fingerprints.<br>
She is not marketable. Women hustle her in public toilets. Press close. She growls low in her throat. Try it with straight friends. First. She cheats at cards. Hustles on the street. Deals in dirt. Writes porn for women. <br>
She goes to the cinema. The man from the apartment opposite her hotel is there. So is his lover. They sit on the floor. Speak maniacally.  They have both written stories. Love stories.  Someone says there's a disturbing element in the audience tonight. They are excessively enthusiastic.<br>
Her lover's bare arms drive her crazy. Over dinner. Her lips hurt.<br>
Two women are in a toilet. On board a train. One of them looks in a mirror. She sees the back of the other's skull. The nape of her neck. Runs warm water over her wrists. Fills her palms. The other woman turns.<br>
She photographs two women. In the park. They are dressed in black sweaters. They exchange briefcases. By a lake. With swans. She frames the scene. Presses the button. <br>
Snap.<br>
Her voice is distant. A glitter in the darkness. In the blackness it snows. By the telephone is a written message. An adult movie in your room. Call the desk. They will charge you dollars. The bodies wait, entangled in the lines. There is nothing on the screen but snow.
Later in her room she listens to some classics. Laughs. Then to some blues.<br>
She departs. At midnight. Walks through the city. The wind is wild. <br>
An actress looking exactly like Greta Garbo will enter from off-screen. In forty minutes time. She will sit at a desk & begin cleaning her gun. She will straighten the seams of her stockings & leave the room. She will lock the door behind her. She will walk down a long hallway.<br>
She takes a pear. From a black leather briefcase. Peels it slowly. Eats it.<br>
Her lover enters the room. She.<br>
Are there any further questions?<br>
Thus, for instance, Freud's study of Dr. Schreber shows clearly that the repression of homosexual desire in anyone who by any commonsense standards was heterosexual, occasioned paranoid psychosis.<br>
Eve Kosofsky.<br>
She coughs. She retches. She pukes. <br>
Words gag her. Early morning scenes.<br>
The phone rings. Her lover's lover. She might be more adorable. She laughs.  <br>
The text ends. She is only beginning. Obsessed.  Haunted. Hunted by words. Hunting for words. The afternoon drags. She stalks her prey.<br>
Her lover leaves the scene. Of a crime. A crime she didn't commit. Someone has drawn a line around a body. On the pavement. There is no body there. She is astonished. She walks on. The light turns yellow.<br>
Her lover leaves the scene. She turns the page.<br>
Will she be arrested?<br>
Noise hurts her ears. Her head thunders.<br>
She yanks the steering wheel hard. The car skids into Deviation Road, Dyke Gulch.<br>
Two women are standing on a dock. Late at night. Deep in conversation. Wearing black trenchcoats. She can see their lips moving. She cannot hear them. Thick fogs rolls in off the bay. The lights halo. Starlight filter. Or diffuser? <br>
Her binoculars freeze to her face. Rips skin off her eye sockets. Bleeds.<br>
Her lover bleeds. Lick. Suck.<br>
Two women bleed. In rhythm.<br>
She watches her lover's arse crossing the floor. Her palms itch. She smirks.<br>  
She frets. She enters the room. In the dark. The air is heavily perfumed. She wakes to the same smell. A pulse throbs in her forehead. Her body adrenalises. She is restless.<br> Outwardly she remains calm.<br>
She neglects other work. Ignores it. Her lover will return. Before 5.30.<br>
Her lover is talking. On the phone. The receiver is glued to her ear. She breathes into the other one. I want 14 strand high voltage wire. Hustle. Telephone wire. I want. She gets what she wants. Always. Give it to me. Now. She blows in her nostril. Her lover wears silver rings. On her fingers. <br>
She has a theory of fucking & flying.<br>
Fucked to heaven.<br>
She leaves before her lover arrives.<br>
She talks during a performance. The performer is furious. Comes on like a fascist. He has lost control. Of his reader. She says she was inspired. She says it sweetly. Without malice. He does not believe her. He is confused. He falls for it anyway. She reviews his performance. For money.<br>
Two women laugh.<br>
Lip. Dip. Suck.<br>
Do finger exercises. On my spine /skull /cunt /nipples /collarbone /thighs.<br>
Get off the phone. "Go away."<br>
Two women fuck till they drop.<br>
Two women board a train. At Spencer St. Station. Together. Lift your arms. They fuck. <br> Casually & gracefully. Pearls scatter. From a broken strand. Bounce hard on the tiles. Let's do it again sometime. Are my seams straight? Is my tie straight?<br>
Her cunt gushes. Salivates. Her lover grabs a handful of swollen cunt /hair /clit /vulva. <br> One squeeze & she comes. Come again sometime. Now. More slowly. & again.<br>
She spits on the pavement. Lights a cigarette. While the water boils. Steam curls up.<br>
The ceiling is flaking.<br>
She pulls on black leather boots. Lightly polished. Cuban Heels.<br>
Her room smells like an armpit. A fox hole. Musky.<br>
The train passes another train. Going in the opposite direction. Air rushes between them. <br> 
The train lurches. Hurtles on.<br>
Two women recognize each other. They have never met.<br>
She says it's a tough dyke scene but you wouldn't mind that would you eyes skim me head to foot. She grins.<br>
She refuses the rules of the game. <br>
Plays with herself. In public. Or in private. She cares less. Piss on it.<br>
Two women knock at a door. Black. Unmarked. It opens a slit. They are granted entry. The club is jammed. Breast to breast women. One of them dances in front of a mirror. One of them has a space of her own. A young bull. They dance till dawn. The bull is solid stone. Fleshly marble. Cold & hard. Ice. Skin with no pores. Studded leather. Stone butch.<br>
She drives her lover with skill. With desire. Drives her wild.<br>
A woman says she makes me uncomfortable. This story is repeated to her. An indeterminate air. She does not fit easily. She draws her own map. An unspeakable sense of identity.<br>
Who has the right to desire narratives?<br>
Who has the desire to be believed?<br>
Her lover has patches. On the knees. Of her jeans. Kneel. Muffed.<br>
She steals secrets. <br>
Sells them on the open market. <br>
She writes a novel. In two weeks. Maybe three. Shit. She just makes it up.<br>
Her lover is talking to her lover. On the phone. She drinks red wine.<br> 
She disassembles & reassembles a postmodern personal & collective self. She codes this self. She is game.<br>
Two women play. At multiplication. She is a mathematician. <br>
It is all over. Everything. Like white on snow. The tube cracks into life.<br>
She runs her finger down the window pane. Makes a mark on the glass. Slightly greasy.<br>
She is caught. <br>
Red handed.<br>
<p>
She carves words into her lover's belly. Blood stains the sheets. Drips onto the carpet. She carves words into her lover's brain.<br>
Cells explode.<br>
The night drags. 4 am.<br>
The words scratch across the page. The music drones. The computer hums.<br>
Two women appropriate luggage. From Lost Property. At the train station. There are railway cars full of suitcases. The man who interprets the dream is a psychiatrist. The woman he interprets it for has given him her suitcase. Two women steal it back. It contains pages of a story about two women who exchange briefcases. The psychiatrist is surprised. The woman who dreamt her suitcase was stolen is not.<br>
She leaves. Someone has cooked for her. How much pasta can you eat? Curry? Chilli would be hotter.<br>
She is cold. Chilled to the bone. Her face feels pale. She tries to think of images. For the text. Nothing happens. They are not there. She tries film. Cannot remember anything significant. She struggles to regain equilibrium. Against depression. Words come heavily. Uneasily. She is tired. Drained. Desire dissolves.<br>
She will never own a Ferrari. She cares nothing.<br>
Her lover is not the same. Depends on how the reader reads.<br>
Eat me.<br>
She sleeps instantly. She wakes on a high. Sleeps again.<br>
Her lover will make money. Like her other lover. Without trying. Hustle. Diplomacy. Hustle me.<br>
Lick me suck me.<br>
The phone rings. She drives all night. Fresh & alone. She drives fast. She will arrive before dawn.<br>
Her skin crawls. Layers peel off her face. Muscle & flesh. Skin my body. Hang it out to dry.
The phone rings. Shit.<br>
Two women talk at night. Everyone has left. They construct a world. A drummer /a singer /a photographer /a life.<br>
Women reveal their unspoken desires to her.  In secret. They bubble to the surface. They dazzle. The narrative is interminable.<br>
She thinks of the words on the window. Boundary words. Borderline text. It floats across. Inside outside.<br>
She constructs herself writing. She writes hard.  She fucks hard.<br>
She steps out onto the sidewalk. Black leather.  Invulnerable. Someone watches this scene. Her shell is her own. She owes nothing.<br>
Desire. Marks her body. Like lightning. Her lover's voice is barely audible. She could kill.
Don't touch my blackness.<br>
Pardon me, I must be going.<br>
There are two obsessions going on in the film:  there's Agatha's obsession & then there's Jo's obsession with her film, & these come together in the end. Jo is unaware of what Agatha has been doing, but at the same time she is making a film that strongly relates to Agatha, so there's some kind of unconscious synchronicity going on. The film that Jo's making brings these elements together in the end. What this produces, ironically, can be seen as a different version of the Oedipal situation. Instead of the woman killing the mother in order to take her place, to be with the father, the man is killed & the woman runs away with the woman. <br>
So, yes, it becomes a sort of happy ending.<br>
The writing stops. Slows.<br>
A question is always a question of desire.<br>
A story too is always a question of desire.<br>
Whose desire is it that speaks?<br>
Whom does the desire address?<br>
She opens a black leather briefcase. Inside is a dossier of facts. A letter. A photograph. & a rye bread sandwich. With cheese. A computer printout. Four books. & a squashed banana.
She pushes through the turnstile. At the subway. Hurtles down two flights. Onto the platform. In one movement. <br>
Two women are seated in a room. Late at night.  One of them is talking softly into the receiver. <br>
One of them writes. Furiously. <br>
She frets. Is ferocious.<br>
Words flow out of her mouth. Down her arm. She smokes her second last cigarette.<br>
Not all the time. Just now. Just this moment. <br>
As I spoke.<br>
She goes out for an anonymous fuck.<br>
Her lover draws a line between her breasts. With the tip of her riding crop. A slight bruise. A mark. The tip of a finger.<br>
She throws dice. Expertly. A deft flick. She has a dragon tattooed on the inside of her wrist. The shaved hair at the nape of her skull glistens. A curl. She finds the other blood red earring on the floor. Near the bed.<br>
She sips red wine. Light turns it ruby. She rubs her earlobe.<br>
The train slows. Stops. The signs of destination are in another language.<br>
Two women dance. Over words. Their meaning is clear. Definite. Unambiguous.<br>
A linguistic strategy. <br>
A discursive intervention.<br>
She loves prodigiously. Precociously.<br>
Promiscuously.<br>
She leaves. She puts the books in her briefcase.  Turns out the light. The music fades.
So, I shall begin again Š<br>
Two women are lying naked. On a bed. In a hotel room. One of them gets up. Puts on a black dress. She picks up a dossier & leaves the room. The other woman wakes up. Gets up. Puts on black pants & sweater.<br>
She puts some items in a briefcase & leaves. Locking the door behind her. The scene cuts to the platform at a train station. Two women are standing on the platform. They do not speak to one another. A train arrives. It departs. Two women are standing on the platform. A train arrives. They board the train. It departs. A man wearing a white hat watches them.   
Two women alight from the train. On the outskirts of the city. They go to a nearby park. With a lake. They exchange briefs & cases. A woman photographs them. The swans swan.
Are you sure?<br>
So Š I lied.
She steps up her quota. Words are inexpensive.  The market is free.<br>
Pay for my pen. I will not tell you. You will buy just the same. Public desire/private fear. Your desire to know.<br>
He avoids her words.<br>
She doesn't shower for several days. Her crotch smells heavenly.<br>
The hours drag. Or speed up. The sax wails. Bump & grind. They play her song. Night Train. She laughs.<br>
& it begins again.<br>
He says is she straight you'd be wasting your time. She is surprised. Are you an expert on women? The band plays jazz. He thinks some women really are straight.<br>
This theory comes as a complete shock to Freud. He is dumbfounded.<br>
On & on. The Sweethearts break into Chatanooga Choo Choo. Two women dance.<br>
Slide over each other's bodies.<br>
She rewinds the night. Plays it again.<br>
Hump. Grind.<br>
Reconstitute my body. Rip my arms off. Stick your finger in my eye socket. Peel me layer by layer.<br>
Hey she says you're weird you know.<br>
The drummer too has a flat top. Cheekbones.  Plays like an angel. Rumour says she's hot.
Hey she says smoke my muff.<br>
Glitter makes her shine.<br>
Two women board a train. One of them leaves a message. With a finger. In the fog. On the window. It dissolves with breathtaking slowness.<br>
She lies. She leaves. No clues.<br>
A reader says did you really lay Š er Š her?<br>
Maybe. Maybe not.<br>
Who desires to know?<br>
Who desires to enter this scene?<br>
Who desires to be believed?<br>
What is involved in the discovery of the "true story" within or behind the events that come to us in the chaotic form of "historical records?" What wish is enacted, what desire is gratified, by the fantasy that real events are properly represented when they can be shown to display the formal coherency of a story? In the enigma of this wish, this desire, we catch a glimpse of the cultural function of narrativizing discourse.<br>
The historian's desire for a moral order.<br>
The pleasure of the text is Š<br>
Two women come. They go.<br>
Who is she anyway?<br>
You can't speak about passion. Your body remembers. No need for you to remember.<br>
Her lover's body is not only one, she is not simply she. & two women are not one, nor even two.<br>
Identity does not equal (=) "identical." OR "isolated."<br>
Two women look at/like each other.<br>
Two sisters redesign each other day & night.<br>
Two women undo the deformations of representation. Achieve gestures.<br>
They say there's a Lesbian heaven.<br>
You go there when you're dead.<br>
But we shouldn't have to die for it Š<br>
Words from a song. She knows them all.<br>
She says sexuality is organised according to what has been said. Slyly.<br>
Two women board a train. At Grand Central. Westbound. Trans Am. In a cafe she said I dreamt I had to walk all the way from New York to Wisconsin. Through the snow. When she arrived in New York she could not find her lover. She also has red hair. & skin like alabaster. The colour of milk. & large breasts. Which actually cleave. She never goes into the sun.<br>
Her lover leaps from the train. Down a steep embankment. Hits the ground running. Crosses the border. All in one movement. She translates documents into other languages. She masquerades. She leaves. No trace. The Government destabilises. The police are anxious. Insecure. Confused.<br>
Her lover<br>
Her lover<br>
Her lover<br>
She repeats<br>
She repeats<br>
She repeats<br>
In her ear. She turns. Crimson.<br>
She says I am crying. Or maybe I am flying. <br>
She mishears. Her lover misbehaves.<br>
The phone rings. It is the man from the apartment opposite her hotel. They tell stories. His is about two women in a hotel room opposite his apartment.<br>
She receives an invitation. "We would be pleased if you could join us for this occasion." <br>
Thursday  6pm 28 September, 1989.<br>
The Minister will be there. The Minister of Photographs.<br>
Two women rewrite the Law of Desire. As laws of desires.<br>
She is wary. Listens intently. At keyholes. Between the lines. She rubs the stubble on her skull. Against the grain. Velvet. Carpet.<br>
She is annoyed. Sleeps. In a state of half wakefulness. She hears scenes from outside the window. Other images run continuously in her brain. They do not fit the voice-over narration from off-screen.<br>
Her lover is depressed. She is high. <br>
This situation is not symmetrical. <br>
She watches her mouth. Fleshy & pink. It dazzles.<br>
She ascends a Grand Staircase. Into a ballroom. In disguise. The Minister of Words grovels. She treads on his foot.<br>
You shouldn't make jokes if it makes you anxious said Isabella.<br>
Two women stage some amazing scenes. She gets off in Atlanta, Georgia. She almost says desire is pure artifice. She puts a quarter in the juke box. Midnight Special. Shoots a mean game of pool. Saunters out of town. Narrows her eyes. Slightly.<br>
She has a fetish for polystyrene cups & plastic forks.<br>
She rolls a cigarette. Casually. Her lover seems older. Today.<br>
She cannot always be indifferent. Her lover has a ruby in her navel & cornflakes in her hair.<br>
She has cruising on her mind.<br>
Her lover sleeps quietly. <br>
She wakes from being watched. <br>
Two women cannot tell the difference between them. The feeling is often uncanny. Like answering the phone before it rings.<br>
She edits thoughts. Writes against desolation. It threatens. The hours before tomorrow are endless. She sits staring at the screen. As though words would appear.<br>
She remembers seeing her lover for the first time. Cruising without consequence. She is reminded abruptly that someone is watching this scene. A woman defends herself against their charged desire. Insists she has a male lover. Somewhere in another city. She continues the seduction in the kitchen. But she becomes wary. Too close. The text is sometimes too full.  The writer finds it hard to read.<br>
Two women stand at the bar. Their shoulders touching. They buy champagne. Unconcerned for the evening.<br>
Isabella once followed a woman she had never seen before. All afternoon. Like a detective. Fascinated. Curious. The photographer in white.<br>
And so she begins again.<br>
She kisses her lover's body. From head to foot. Every centimetre. Slowly. For most of the night.   She stands at the attic window. Watching the top of her lover's head. Crossing the snow.  She leaves footprints. By morning they will be gone.<br>
The timetable for the trains is pinned behind the door. In the hotel lobby. Near the lift. The train for London departs Friday evening. The train for Frankfurt never leaves.<br>
She is undecided. She takes the lift to the fifth floor. She sees no one. This does not surprise her in the least.<br>
She spreads jam on a croissant. Calmly. The men in the Government are extremely agitated. Defeat is imminent. Or chaos. She picks up her briefcase & walks down a long hallway.<br>
Her lover has class. Upper middle. She has class. Street smarts. This situation is not equal. Nor symmetrical. It is not even reversible. Her lust escalates.<br>
Two women ignore warning signals. Sex is exchange value. The Law of Capital.<br>
She takes a train. For destinations unknown. Sometime after the event she wrote a novel.<br>
In fact two novels. Blended together. About the ambivalence of bisexuality. The undecidability of desire. Constant slippage.<br>
She slips away at the last moment. Autonomy is important to her. Also.<br>
She writes. The same thing. Differently. Over & over.<br>
Soft fleshiness.<br>
Everyone in the photograph looks so much like themselves. Just like themselves.<br>
Why the question mark? Why these words?<br>
Why are they here?<br>
