On a warm evening in 1726 a man was arrested on the open ground near the city called the Moorfields.<br> That night two constables had gone out in the aftermath of the trials & executions of that year to see if further arrests could be made.  They arrested a man named William Brown. <br>That night ended for him in imprisonment & probably the ruin of his life. In court he watched his words carefully, but when he was faced with arrest & the violent abuse of the constables he spoke with feeling. <br>
It is hardly surprising. He had known Thomas Wright who had recently been executed for sodomy & he had lived with the tensions & fears of the last year.<br> "I did it because I thought I knew him," he replied.<br> "And I think there is no crime in making what use I please of my own body."<br>
Her lover is shouting up from the street. Under her window. She has been at the cinema. While the die was cast. <br>
A woman watches from the window of a hotel opposite her lover's apartment. Governments have been known to fall.<br>
The Underground is full of dead skin cells. They float interminably on the air. A train roars through.
The phone rings. At 7 am. She is instantly alert.  She desires to redesign something. Writing makes her laugh. She loves writing. Love makes her laugh. Harder. The latter is ambiguous. So is the former. The reader hesitates. For a moment.  Reads on.
Fantasy is a defence against the anxiety of influence.<br>
She checks the time. Tightens her grip on the briefcase. She checks the map. Again. Another train pulls into the station.<br>
She thinks god is probably a tart too.<br>
These words & photographs would be untranslatable or unintelligible in a city whose inhabitants did not speak the language. Everything changes in the event.
At 2 pm precisely Wednesday 6 September  1990 she enters upstage. She is carrying a briefcase. She orders coffee & a small cake. With fruit on top. She smokes a long thin cigar. A man asks for a light. He waits for recognition. <br>
She does not look up.<br>
An actress looking like Greta Garbo will appear in a tailored white suit. Smoking a small cigar. From behind the door. In twenty minutes time. She will lean casually against the wall. Under a streetlight. She is carrying a gun. She will pretend not to know you.<br>
Her lover hustles a tonne of marble. Builds a monument. Says there. Hustles two tonnes of marble.<br>
She says do you know what it's worth on the open market.<br>
The laws of Orleans in 1260 codified the punishment for female sodomy in Li livres de jostice et de plet: A woman was to be mutilated for her first & second sexual offences with another woman & burned to death for her third.<br>

At a party her lover pretends not to know her. The room smells of gasoline. She parks her motorcycle in the hallway.<br>
Two women are integrated into the circuit. One of them has steel teeth. One of them has a honey tongue. Mega bite. Offshore women. Hit & run cultural drivers. Microelectronic with speed. They can outrun you. Beat you at your own game.<br>
Releasing the play of writing is deadly serious.<br>
Her lover enters from behind the door. The answer is yes. She will come. Tomorrow evening. Or tomorrow. She is overjoyed. But calm. She plots another novel. She plots another fuck. She plots another fucking novel. She plots a novel fuck.<br>
She plots an omelette. But she has to break eggs.<br>
Her lover has green eyes. This surprises her a great deal. She has green eyes. Like grapes.
Two women have green eyes. One of them eats lotus blossoms. One of them wears steel capped boots. This situation is reversible. Not symmetrical. Just reversible. At any moment. This is just one.<br>
She is tired. She falls asleep with her clothes on. In the morning she is surprised to find herself already dressed. Her body smells of armpits & stale piss. Paradise.<br>
Her lover will stay for two months. Then she will make another film. The delirium ceases. Abruptly.<br>
She ties her lover down. With silk cords. Do you mind. I could lick your body from head to foot.  Wear velvet gloves. Don't expect immediate gratification. You will beg for mercy. In time. You could flick hot wax. On your skin. The pain is delicious.<br>
I could suffer.<br>
Two women play tops. Neither wants to play bottom. Who's running this fuck anyway.
The structure of the play does not move neatly from pain to promise. The divisions within them remain unresolved. She is sad Š<br>
Her lover says she can pass for straight. If for some bizarre reason she should want to. But she cannot pass for white in this city. The issue of passing is quite closely related to the frame of vision & the conditions of representation. Passing demands silence. Masquerade. 
Her lover passes as wife. <br>
Repeat After Me: We Are Different. We Are the Same.<br>
Watch my lips move.<br>
There is nothing between her body & her desire for women. Her lover has bare arms.
Two women are disloyal to civilisation. Their own reality is not represented. Their attention is elsewhere.<br>
But attention is a "kind of passion."<br>
Two women play at butch/femme or s/m. For a day. Or on other days. They do not suffer. Nor impale themselves on metaphysics. They seduce the sign system. One of them flirts. One of them is inconstant. They enjoy the light fondle of artifice. They do dyke bars.<br>
Four women dine together. Their names begin with the same letter. The Law of words. No two women have the same name.<br>
No one is unaware of what takes place here.<br>
And what takes place here.<br>
Two women are theorising as/in fiction.<br>
Her novel was put on trial. For obscenity. The time is 1928 Š<br>
Pardon me, I must be going.<br>
Very well. I shall begin again.<br>
Two women board a train. Their destination is unclear. Unethical & undetermined. They exchange briefcases. This is the Law of Exchange. Or the Law of Briefcases.<br>
She turns & sees herself there. She kisses her mouth.<br>
She stares at her lover's desk. The page lies unwritten.<br>
Two women sit in a darkened cinema. One of them shouts we just want pleasure. The audience remains attentively silent.<br>
She suddenly remembers Another Way. A doomed love affair. Between two women journalists. In Hungary. During a politically volatile period. Someone says the film is truly erotic. The time is 1956.<br>
The idea chills her to the bone. She is electrified.<br>
Her lover turns. Warm from sleep. Her body is covered in sweat. She smells of heat & fucking. Her eyes are transparent. She stretches. Slides her body over the sheets. Her lips brush her lover's shoulder. Morning scenes. The street is silent.<br>
Her cunt hovers between pleasure & pain.<br>
She goes outside. Onto the fire escape. She sits down. Perplexed. No use now Š pretending to be two people.<br>
She growls softly in her throat.<br>
Nothing happens. Absolutely nothing.<br>
TRUE happiness eludes her. She laughs out loud.<br>
Sign here. Sign on the dotted line. Sign your life away. She pisses. A great relief to her mind. Really.<br>
Two women turn the tables.<br>
She says you better come on tough. So nobody messes with you.<br>
4 pm. Her lover has not arrived.<br>
Two women board a train at Bastille. An express. She thinks of Dark Times. Their legs caress. One of them looks.<br>
Her lover turns. Presses her knee gently between her legs. They part.<br>
An actress who looks like Greta Garbo will board the train. In fourteen minutes time. She will be smoking a small cigar. She will be wearing a pith helmet. She will know you by the colour of your eyes. She will leave the train before it reaches its destination. She will leave another in its place.<br>
At a glance two men say this is difficult to read. One of them says it is not as easy as it looks.<br>
She gazes into space. Her lover is an astronomer.<br>
Touch here. Caress this spot. & here. She has a number tattooed on the nape of her neck. Under her skin. Eat my skull eat my bones suck out my brains rip out my spine. Serenity becomes her.<br>
She is a wicked woman. A fatal femme. She always seems to be noir lit.<br>
Work piles up. It is serious. But not urgent. She cares less. Words pile up.  <br>
She sees a woman with red hair. In the street. She looks again.<br>
Her lover spreads the map on the floor. She is pensive. A dark blue line dissects the city.  Unresolved. She picks up a pen.<br>
Two women wear black. At night. One of them has a gold chain. Around her throat. One of them has a leather band. On her wrist. They are connected. Somehow. In time.
She stumbles by chance on a fragment of a photograph. In the gutter. The train thunders toward Vers-Roissy.<br>
Imagine a woman who steals letters.<br>
Imagine a woman who exposes photographs.<br>
AT 8pm  precisely the performance will begin. The door will be locked. No one will enter after 8.02.<br>
Her lover turns. She almost touches her shoulder. Someone is watching this scene.
In the night she is restless. The TV. does not comfort her. She prowls the room. Words do not console her. The image of a woman's body haunts her. A TV. monitor is mounted in the window. The text is on the screen.<br>
The man in the Metro is the lover of the man from the apartment opposite her hotel. His window has no blinds. He will be carrying a notebook. He will be smoking a long thin cigar. He will be wearing a white hat.<br>
Scientific photography assumed the position of being merely a reflex of the real. This reality was limited to the exterior of the body, because emulsions were insensitive to red. Thus favoured in photography were diseases which erupted on the surface of the body. Skin diseases, burns. We are shown the body cut open, flesh minus skin. These are subjects which are marked.  Split one from the other. This split is either healed & the subject allowed to return to the world in which her right to speak is returned or she dies within this space literally or in terms of a continued silence in the forms of confinement.<br>
Medical Police.<br>
I shall begin again. Two women board a sky blue train. One of them is carrying a briefcase. It is connected to her wrist. By a gold chain.<br>
The man in the apartment opposite her hotel is seated at his desk. He is writing a love story.<br>
She struts her stuff down the Boulevard Bourdon. To La Bastille. Beside the canal. Reverses down Boulevard De La Bastille. Hey babe.<br>
She snaps the video off. She is distracted. By heat & noise. Her lover waits. The bar is crowded.<br>
She wants. She wants more. Her lover turns toward her. Her hands are suddenly all over her body. You think desire. It is all the more intense. Your desire for her body.<br>
Who is addressed here?<br>
Who has the right to desire narratives?<br>
Who has the desire to be believed?<br>
She performs out of turn. She refuses the role written for her. Write me another.<br>
She says go out & beat someone up.<br>
On Wednesday 6th September her lover enters stage right. She is wearing a dress. They exchange looks. The Law of Looks.<br>
She dozes. She wakes. Comes downstairs.<br>
Her lover is there. At her desk. She is ecstatic. Plays Country & Western music.<br>
Are you sure of that? <br>
The phone rings. It is the man from the apartment opposite her hotel. He says I am calling from New York. She can see his mouth moving.<br>
Two women board a light blue train. One of them pulls the stop cord. Between stations. One of them leaves the train. In the centre of a desert. She crosses the border. At night.<br>
She cruises another city. Wearing black levis/boots/leather jacket/sunglasses. She flaunts her arse down Bourbon Street. The rhythm in her head, Lights are bright. The air is warm outside. A woman with black eyes says Hiya babe.<br>
Are there further questions?<br>
Nonetheless such questions are easily eclipsed, or simply left unasked.<br>
For whom?<br>
Against whom?<br>
These perverts will frequently attempt to entice normal individuals to engage in perverted practices. This is particularly true in the case of young & impressionable people who might come under the influence of a pervert Š One homosexual can pollute a Government Š (office).<br>
United States Senate<br>
81st Congress, 2nd Session, Committee on Expenditure in Executive Departments.<br>
Employment of Homosexuals & Other Sex Perverts in Government, Washington, 1950.<br>
She finds objects. She has no will to silence.  She wilfully confuses truth & fiction. Accords primacy to pleasure & fantasy. Her desire is political. She tells stories. She lies. Her story is already written. But not "already read." She confiscates images. Adds other meanings.
Looking for the structure of the narratives is like looking for the pear shape in Satie's composition Three Pieces in a Pear Shape.<br>
She went on with the story & she never stopped. She doesn't have a rational past.<br>
She remains distant impassive ironical & watching. Every word every image is leased & mortgaged. Sometimes she feels like she is suffocating. From overcoding.<br>
Her lover is attractive to men. They hit on her.  She finds their faith in the idea that you can't have real sex without a dick very touching. They seem nervous & insecure. His desire is for an image.<br>
She wonders if drugs would help.<br>
Good ones as the saying goes.<br>
Her lover arrives with flowers & strawberries. She eats them mashed. With a spoon. & chocolate cake with her fingers. Her lover goes to a Sleaze Ball. <br>
On Sunday it rains. She sleeps all day. Watches films. Watches Schwestern. Drinks tea from a china pot. She writes. Ferociously. Into the night. The younger sister is distraught. Weeping.<br>
Human cells split & fuse. Doubling & multiplying.<br>
Who has desire?<br>
For what?<br>
Her skin cringes from the heat. Searing. This drives her mad.<br>
Her sister is seated at her desk. Weeping. Alone. At night. She will be writing in a notebook. She will die before morning.<br>
Two women lie flat on the bed. On their backs. Hands spread beside their bodies. Fingers outstretched. Touching. Barely.<br>
Her lover's skin is exposed. <br>
Words fail her.<br>
She gazes at the soft down of her armpits. Transfixed. In mid sentence.<br>
The younger sister has written "When I'm dead place a stone on my face so I won't haunt you.<br>
 When I'm dead cut off one of my hands & bury it at the crossroads so I won't rise again & torment you. I've killed myself against you. You are the target of my death therefore protect yourself against me."<br>
The writer says not wanting success<br>
Her lover is the object. Of her desire. The object of writing. She is not only thus.<br>
Are you sure of that?<br>
She moves her hand across her lover's belly. Down into the soft blond hair. She curls it gently around her fingertip. Pulls up abruptly. Her lover grins. Her eyes are wet. She moves her fingers further. Touches the electric space to the left of her lover's clit. Her legs spasm. Big belly muscles contract. Relax. Her fingers snakes down the join between thigh & cunt. She will pretend to be asleep. She will smile. Without meaning (to). She pulls her lover's body into her own. Breathes in her hair. Traces a line dissecting armpit & breast
A fine red line.<br>
She looks in a mirror & sees the back of her skull & the nape of her neck.<br>
Her cunt throbs. She writes.<br>
Three women plot a performance. A coup. <br>
She goes out for cigarettes.<br>
A man accosts her outside the train station. She offers to reduce his nuts to pulp with her knee. He stops following her. She does not look back.<br>
Two women caress each other.<br>
Two women fuck. Roughly & urgently. I could nick your skin with a razor. Here. Watch the blood flow. Suck. Lick. Sink my teeth in your throat. Lick your arsehole. Lick the soles of your feet. Till you die. Stick my finger in your dimple. Clasp handfuls of hair in my hand. 
Squeeze my fist. Tightly. Fist fuck. Scream.<br>
I could suffer.<br>
She says you can't sneeze without closing your eyes. I've tried to.<br>
She is dehydrated from salt & tequila & the night before.<br><p>
