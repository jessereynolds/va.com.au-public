<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=4>My guide and I carefully selected our item which I then
purchased using my father's money. I still remember clearly our journey
back from that indiscrete neighbourhood: the lattice of little streets
brindled with soft rain; the cheerful and nonchalant passing of messengers
who we imagined were accompanying or parsing our gentle excitement; the way
the late shadows made bowers for our tenderness, there among the sooty
shops peddling used cups and hairpieces, and the hawkers and their
fractured syntax, and the smell of spoiled fruit lingering in the moist air
like an outmoded style of punctuation. Each matched, quickening step we
took was a fresh conceit for the fibrous intimacy this new item promised to
ambassador; or rather it was old content, even, though I may seem
indelicate, used, since the tiny, poorly lit shop where we had chosen it, a
shop whose shabbiness was strangely distinguished by the murmur of cultish
erudition and disdain among its cloaked habitués, offered many slightly
differing items, some enigmatic as to the techniques of their application,
others of an obtuseness that titillated our inexperience though seeming to
promise only minimal subtleties, but all related in their concupiscence and
great antiquity. Each was a genred enigma of ancient dignity. We had chosen
only after having appealed to the somewhat intimidating expertise of the
shopkeeper who had, with hushed authority, advised us to consider
methodically both the unique and the banal qualities of each item until a
latent texture compelled itself towards our skin. Now, on the strewn
pavements, our urgency increased in proportion to the luxurious withdrawal
of light from the greased sky. We ignored the crowds that we resembled.
This was a journey of hurried, determined steps, of distant irregularities,
of involuting grammars, of tumescence and slurried rain. I tightened my
clasp on the scarlet packet that seemed so generously to absorb the pulse
of my anticipation. I believed that soon my cherished guide and I would
become dependents of experience. We hardly limped at all.<P>

The weather smeared a ripe grey evenly over the lengths of our bodies. My
guide and I talked about cold things to punctuate our adjacency. Sometimes
our sentences began to cancel our flesh, their stately clefts of emotion
erasing our bounded proprieties. And yet the hard structures of our palates
were palpitating something tender and immaculate. I wanted to think I was
commensurate with our marbling breath; during the onset of this journey I
couldn't imagine memory or sleep, only the unpractised intimacy of fingers
and jewels. And I must refer also to our phonemes which in the soft air
seemed to gloss earth with its sullen particles. Our woollen sleeves
mingled their shining, raised sheaths; my heart was suspended in the icy
sky, sifting and rationing gesture. Early evening had pulled after it an
imprecise dusk. All of this gave us more time.

Our desultory conversation had veiled the inadvertent transgression of our
route into the Secular District. The courts of my fathers sanctuaries
trickled their viscous light into the scoured streets. Hewn columns flanked
our trepidation. A tersely bent figure passed with tight-hipped gait,
purposefully diminishing into the hostile iteration of a colonnade. We
exposed ourselves to grimly imagined dangers in navigating this district:
in fact this was necessary since such foreboding protected our bodies with
hot surges of attentiveness. We scanned the shadowed gateways and clinging
porches; we realized we would be known by our steps if they were heardby
savants. Our ambered fragrance also distinguished us from the obliterate
bodies that frequented this district, and the woollen coats brushing our
ankles were of a flexible cut little appreciated by tenured priests and
acolytes. I slipped our purchase into my deep inner pocket. The subtle
pressure of its weight against my torso transferred to me a sensation of
quietude, as if that latinate sweetness drew to itself the spontaneous
rhetoric of happiness - I felt, like Creusa, both inviolate and
assuaged.<P>

Beyond the porticoed towers the broad street rose to address a sort of
quincunx or grove. Generations of acolytes had remapped the city's inchoate
routes to lead to their district's venerated mound. My guide and I, like
many other travellers, were pleased to briefly enjoy the hospice of that
thick set wood. For we were not alone among the pedestaled trees that named
the myths of liberty. We knew our sylvan companions among pommier
d'Antoinnette, Fiennesque elm, Nosier de Certeau, by the same means we had
feared would precipitate our own recognition. Garments of rare subtlety and
variety spoke the generous courage of their wearers - soft seams modelled
mobile torsos, drape of ineluctable cloths both foregrounded and refined
gesture and gait, fanning collars shielded the tenuous vulnerability of
throats. But as we penetrated the semi-lit margin of foliage to join this
covert gathering, we saw, half concealed in cedar and prodigious mist, a
gold cab with brazen threshold. Through dark glass the leaning driver
covertly signalled. The door swung open on mute hinges. We entered the
insuperable femininity of neglect. We receded into upholstered
anonymity.<P>

I would prefer to narrate an indiscernible movement towards a pronoun caked
in doubt, but the gentle rocking of the car, the mock innocence of gesture,
the closed-in heat, hid certainties. I did not know that these surfaces
locked. In that life, in that narrative, a shared object shaped our moral
cusp. I thought of my guide, who was like a text that converts itself
through the most inexplicable activities - erased reflexes, ineptitude,
insensitive deposits - as if the dispersed will could simply become
something. Under the faintly saffron skin, beneath the curved black hairs
that seemed engraved in their exactitude, under that loose skin with slight
texture visible as a screen, a history of oblivious proportions hid itself
in the brackish pleasure of its own autonomy. It was washed up into this
fissure in the body like a swollen board would be. This history was giving
my guide life from a slightly altered or washed perspective which seemed to
me invaluable or at least precious. We were listing on stained upholstery
in the back seat of the cab. Our loose comfort metred the pocked road, the
sudden turns and pauses. Blurred neighbourhoods slid past the glass:
indulged white sculpture, burnt odour coming forward, glass grid, fringes
of dust, errant monument, lit inscription and condensed ornament, darkened
market, republican lustre of oil on canal water, threshold, embassy, paper,
mast. I thought about my guides stolid happiness, a happiness that
circulated as a substance or a vapour might, sometimes to linger at the
churlish skin, at other times to rush through the limbs as a mobility of
means, and sometimes to pool around the gilded organs, remotivating the
ancient tenure of introspection. My guide's was a practised thought which
administrated unknowable generosities of detail with felicity. Yet this
complexity was sparingly deployed. Observing my guide had taught me that
happiness is the consolidation of complicities.<P>

Undoubtedly I am misunderstood. Although I am not unaware of the fraught
uses of this belling word 'complicity', the company of my guide had
pleated, among its maligned syllables, intimations of the byzantine bonds
fastening want to its soft cage. That 'we' in its moot atmosphere, clinking
against knowledge and queens, was circumfluent to the propriety of doubt.
If we were abstract, if we cupped ambiguity and translucence, we also gave
to one another the spurious syntax of thought. Books swell and shirts
flower: events please their geometry only by deferring bounds. But these
words are vagaries that cannot indicate the wanton suppleness with which we
attached ourselves to the tensing flesh. We were held to our wandering by
permissive texts that also reconciled our itinerant lusts: our simplest
membranes applied themselves to the world only under its querulous
agreement. I know that when I say 'the world' I resort to a tired method of
scraping at submerged pronominal obedience. Each pronoun was a willing link
in a chain of a nonchalant extravagance that locked us to both luxury and
thought. Hopefulness bent into its own opacity. Even the terse display of
grief concealed reflexive superfluities. (I speak here of the civic grief
that has passed from sorrow to anger, as such grief does during the
extremes of ethical abandonment.) As love requires a politics, so
worldliness cathects. Flower and beak both mimic and demand our spate.<P>

Then, in the humming silence of the cab, movement of that inexorable body
closer to mine. My guide said:<P>

"There are distances so detailed you feel forced to construct belief. But
it's the same finite drama of utterance. Something is not being
represented."<P>

"Twenty five miles away, antiquity soaks through the categories of
derision, enforces the tenuous semblance of the body. Beneath the ochre
syllables other syllables; beneath judgement, effaced codes of fear. The
body is posed in its setting: but the big romantic rivers are analogies not
rivers and their bridges are log bridges dripping creosote into silt. The
bridge and the river are not landscape  - nor is the forest, with its
archival plenitude and entanglement. Those august fragments institute
complicity's tenure and catalogue. They tilt the screens of judgement by
cheating their dependents; they flaunt styles of defence engorged with
guilt. They spend the florid texts of fated alliances. They import, then
shame foreign structures of loveliness to buttress their greed. In the
atrophied grammar of the sacred they compose the incommunicable biographies
of need. Our clerical earth thus exudes itself. And the carved ruckus of
milky bark is a diary of placation repeating ad infinitum "we want to love,
we want to love".<P>

"Or the heart's chic diphthong breaks. Black ink trickles through your arms
and it has written landscapes. Across the broad valley one duped term of a
simile declares itself autonomous. The trees have posed undreamed of
questions. Do bright thrones yield civil shade? One day you will laugh at
even this substitute, this obedience, this green hope."<P>

Kids in their nylon halos of beauty were passing. We saw the streetlamps
annotate their grace. Loose certainties of gait forestalled astonishment.
Our car, still for a moment, occupied the centre of all their luminosity. I
was witnessing my own desire, as if erased, and it was something like
history: a frivolously maintained dependency on the cancelled chimeras of
place, the obscene luxury of an analysis that rejects what it next
configures as reversed. Nevertheless I wanted</font>
