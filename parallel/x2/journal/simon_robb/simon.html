<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=4><A HREF = "#note1">1</A>. What manner of man is this, or what
manner of creature is it in the semblance of man? I feel the dread of this
horrible place overpowering me; I am in fear,in awful fear, and there is no
escape for me; I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think
of. . . .

<P>
<A HREF = "#note2">2</A>. He's <A NAME="eyes">looking</A> down at me. He's
got a ruler in his hand. Has a tip of silver. Touches me. I see pictures of
the world just blowing up (Long pause). I <A HREF = "#pictures">see
pictures</A> of the whole place just blowing up when he touches my head
with this thing (Weeps).
<P>
<A HREF = "#note3">3</A>. Looking implies that the object viewed covers and
uncovers itself, that it disappears at every instant, for looking
involves a kind of oscillation. These images however, are not caught in a
game of emergence and disappearance. The body is already there <I>without
even the faintest glimmer of a possible absence</I>, in a state of radical
disillusion; the state of pure presence.
<P>

<A HREF = "#note4">4</A>. <A NAME="her">Shuddering</A> at the memory, Kelly
says that out of nowhere a tall, black figure began moving toward them. "I
had expected to see a human being, but this was not human - its shape was
all wrong," she says. "I was overwhelmed by the most horrifying fear. The
creature's eyes seemed to turn to a red fire." Suddenly there were many
more creatures, a mass of glowing red eyes gliding across the field towards
them. "I was transfixed. Their power or energy was unfathomable. Then I
felt a whoomph in my stomach and I was on the ground, winded. I couldn't
see. I heard my husband scream; 'Let go of me'. I heard a clear male voice
respond: 'we mean you no harm'. My husband said: 'Why did you hit Kelly
then?' and the thing said: 'I wouldn't harm her. After all, I am her
father'. I heard a chuckle and I thought, this is evil. I threw up, and
began sobbing. The next thing I knew I was sitting in the car."
<P>

<A HREF = "#note5">5</A>. These are the couplings which make Man and Woman
so problematic, subverting the structure of desire, the force imagined to
generate language and gender, and so subverting the structure and modes of
reproduction of Western identity, of nature and culture, of mirror and eye,
slave and master, body and mind. "We" did not originally choose to be
cyborgs . . . .
<P>

<A HREF = "#note6">6</A>. I felt embarrassed . . . but I wanted a record of
some sort . . . . if I had told the reporters that <A HREF =
"#visit">alleged visitors</A> were in any way involved, it seemed to me
that there was a probability that my credibility would be destroyed.

<P>

<A HREF = "#note7">7</A>. The <A NAME="human">subject</A> is named by
being tagged or branded on its surface creating a particular kind of
"depth-body" or interiority, a physic layer the subject identifies as its
<A HREF = "#space">(disembodied)</A> core. Subjects thus produced are not
simply the imposed results of alien, coercive forces; the body is
internally lived, experienced and acted upon by the subject and the social
collectivity . . . the subject is marked as a series of (potential)
messages from/of the (social) Other . . . .
<P>

<A HREF = "#note8">8</A>.They're <A NAME="observe">wearing</A> blue
uniforms. Dark blue uniforms. They're sort of grey. They look like they
haven't been out in the sun in ten years. Sort of mushroomy grey. <A HREF =
"#vomit">Smell</A> funny too. Like a burned match head. Just totally
expressionless faces . . . This has to be a dream, because the dog is
sleeping like the dead. Why do you feed a dog?
<P>
<A HREF = "#note9">9</A>. Then, almost three months later to the day, her
questions were answered. Once again the couple were driving on the same
stretch of road to their friend's house, when a gut-wrenching dread swept
over Kelly. In a flash, vivid memories came flooding back.
<P>
<A HREF = "#note10">10</A>. <A NAME="hunt">On</A> the TV monitor, rigid on
a laboratory slab, is a childlike creature whose big bald head is
pear-shaped, nose and ears tiny, and mouth a lipless slit. . . each hand
and foot has six digits . . . . One of the three men in white bio-hazard
suits, gloves and visored hoods makes a scalpel incision in the top of the
creature's chest and draws the blade down its thorax and abdomen. He cuts
to the top of the chest and the skin is peeled away to reveal the main body
cavity. A dark blood-like substance oozes. Fleshy organs are removed and
placed in surgical trays. One spherical organ in the stomach resembles
nothing in the human anatomy. Next, dark, flimsy lenses are plucked with
tweezers <A HREF = "#eyes">from the creature's eyes</A>, revealing pupils.
The skull is sawn open, a 'brain' removed.
<P>
<A HREF = "#note11">11</A>. Biological, anatomical, physiological and
neuro-physiological processes cannot be automatically attributed a natural
 status. It is not clear that what is biological is necessarily natural . .
. The raw materials themselves are not "pure" in so far as culture, social
and psychological factors intervene to give them their manifest forms. . .

<P>
<A HREF = "#note12">12</A>. I can't wait to get home, to wash, wash. Scrub,
scrub. The formalin must have crystallised in my nostrils because I smell
it all the time. I've stopped eating corned beef. The colour reminds me too
much of the cadaver. One night I vomited after dinner when I realised I
hadn't been scrupulous enough to lift bits of flesh from under my finger
nails. I ate an infinitesimal bit of him and I spewed months and months of
dissection. I find it difficult to touch food with my hands. I'm never sure
if my hands are clean enough . . . I pretended not to hear when asked if I
would work some more on Tom-Dick-Harry. I made up my mind that "he" was an
IT.
<P>
<A HREF = "#note13">13</A>.The <A NAME="confront">foreigner</A> is within
us. And when we flee from or struggle against the foreigner, we are
fighting our own unconscious - that "improper" facet of our impossible
"own and proper." Delicately, analytically, Freud does not speak of
foreigners: he teaches us how to detect foreignness in ourselves. That is
perhaps the only way not to hound it outside of us. After Stoic
cosmopolitanism, after religious universalist integration, Freud brings us
the courage to call ourselves disintegrated in order not to integrate
foreigners and even less so to hunt them down, but rather to welcome them
to that uncanny strangeness, which is as much theirs as ours.
<P>
<A HREF = "#note14">14</A>. <A NAME="touch">Suddenly</A> I felt a hand on
my shoulder, and heard the Count's voice saying to me "Good morning." I
started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of
the glass covered the whole room behind me . . . Having answered the
Count's salutations, I turned <A HREF = "#hunt">to the glass again</A> . .
. The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no sign of a man in
it, except myself.
<P>
<A HREF = "#note15">15</A>. In <A NAME="theory">the</A> widespread
paralysis of the collective or social imaginary, to which "nothing occurs"
(Karl Kraus) when confronted with the ambitious program of fantasising an
economic system on the scale of the globe itself, the older motif of
conspiracy knows a fresh lease of life, as a <A HREF = "#nar">narrative
structure</A> capable of reuniting the minimal basic components: a
potentially infinite network, along with a plausible explanation of its
invisibility . . . .
<P>
<A HREF = "#note16">16</A>. Still shaken from the experience, they decided
to try to forget about it and go to bed. But when Kelly went to the
bathroom she was shocked to find she was bleeding menstrually, even though
she had finished her period the week before. She also discovered a small
triangular scar on her abdomen. Kelly's bleeding continued for three weeks
and she was finally hospitalised with an infection in her uterus. A
pregnancy test proved negative.
<P>
<A HREF = "#note17">17</A>. The <A NAME="space">conquest</A> of space
constitutes . . . an irreversible threshold which effects the loss of <A
HREF = "#human">terrestrial coordinates</A> and referentiality. Reality, as
an internally coherent and limited universe, begins to haemorrhage when
its limits are stretched to infinity. The conquest of space, following the
conquest of the planet, promotes either the de-realising of human space, or
the reversion of it into a simulated hyperreality.
<P>
<A HREF = "#note18">18</A>. The <A NAME="pictures">human</A> shape I can
get now, almost with ease, so that it is lithe and graceful, or thick and
strong; but often there is trouble with the hands and claws - painful
things that I dare not shape too freely . . . These creatures of mine
seemed strange and uncanny to you as you began to observe them, but to me,
just after I make them, they seem to be indisputable human beings. It's
afterwards, as I <A HREF = "#observe">observe them</A>, that the persuasion
fades. First one animal trait, then another, creeps to the surface and
stares out at me . . . But I will conquer yet. Each time I dip a creature
into a bath of burning pain, I say, this time I will burn out all the
animal, this time I will make a rational creature of my own.
<P>
<A HREF = "#note19">19</A>. For Haraway, cyborg does not necessarily name
the tragic confusion of identities that follows on scientific hubris. On
the contrary, it may name the condition of freedom from the illegitimate
categories of "nature" race, gender, species, kingdom) - a freedom that
can only emerge with the destruction of those rationalities and of the
mythologies of essential unity .
<P>
<A HREF = "#note20">20</A>.<A NAME="visit">That</A> story began back in the
US summer of 1947. Dates and witness reports are contradictory, but the
alleged close encounter happend early in July, as a night of storm raged
around the farming and oil-and-gas producing town of Roswell on the Pecos
River. Some locals saw a flash of grey-blue light in the sky they swore
were neither thunder nor lightning. Simultaneously, according to some
accounts, radar operators...who had been tracking a mystery object in the
sky saw it disappear from their screens. The army investigated and next
morning whisked away debris of a crashed flying object and - vow some
witnesses - alien bodies . . . civilians who saw the clean-up say they were
sworn to secrecy . . . .
<P>

<A HREF = "#note21">21</A>. Listen, baby, I've been coping with this for so
many years. I know this invasion gets in. As soon as you get close to
something important, that's when you feel this invasion, and that's the way
you know something's there. I've felt myself just marched up like a puppy
to go and do something that would get me insulted or humiliated. I was not
in control. Then the ultimate dream I had, I saw my body walking out of the
room - this is in Chicago - bent on some deadly errand, and I'm just up on
the ceiling sort of fading out, with no power at all. That's the ultimate
horror of possession. There are all degrees of possession. It happens all
the time. What you have to do is <A HREF = "#confront">confront the
possession</A>.
<P>
<A HREF = "#note22">22</A>. <A NAME="vomit">In</A> the following days,
Kelly tried to discuss the issue with her husband, but although he agreed
that he had seen a UFO and remembered smelling vomit during the drive home,
he doesn't agree that they blacked out, or that any time was unaccounted
for, or that they met aliens. The couple began to fight constantly - he was
determined to forget the experince, which left Kelly traumatised, depressed
and afraid <A HREF = "#her">of going insane</A>.
<P>
<A HREF = "#note23">23</A>. <A NAME="nar">Medicine</A> is built up on
examples and experience; so is my <A HREF = "#theory">theory</A>.
