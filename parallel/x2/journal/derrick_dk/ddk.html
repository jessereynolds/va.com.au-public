<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=4>The rapid development of art on the Net is one more proof that
artists are among the first people to use new media and make them
perceivable as environments open to more than utilitarian and functional
use . One of the roles of art addressing technological transformation is to
bring out the human content, the metaphorical over and above the functional
or litteral value of the unfolding technological environment. In times of
great
structural changes of the collective mind, the artist's job is to make
people aware of such changes and create the new decors and sensory
experiences afforded by them.<P>

On the other hand, the evidence of art and of art's role on the Net only
dawned on people after Mosaic tranformed the World Wide Web from a
cooperative computer-supported work software technology into a tool for
esthetic expression. Within weeks, homepages were vying for attention with
as much colour and movement and sound as the carrying lines and the
patience of the user could bear. Among the first institutions to get a site
on the Web were museums and galleries with scanned images and navigable
itineraries. Perhaps <A HREF = "http://cutl.city.unisa.edu.au/wm/">Nicolas
Pioch</A>'s quick and dirty posting of treasures of Le Louvre in early 1993
did more to awaken people to the possibilities of the Web than many others.
Today, a simple tour of artbased websites via Yahoo opens up access to so
many sites that it's already too late to hope to visit them all. Sites and
homepages devoted to art galleries and museums, public or private, famous
or unknown, number in the thousands.<P>

However, were it to be limited to such use, art on the Web would not be
very interesting. It would be no more than just another delivery system for
the art market. The real nature of the Net is to act as a forum for
collective memory and imagination practiced by different groups in
different configurations in extended real-time . The screen of each
individual user substitutes for the display function of one's own
imagination and memory. But what is accessed on the Net is other people's
imagination and memory and the access is both private and collective, both
static and dynamic, both archived and contextualized. In that regard, the
Net delivers the promises of Virtual Reality which is to make real-time
instant imagination externalized on a screen and thus "objective" in a
paradoxical way. It is, after all "walkable". But while stand-alone VR can
at best accomodate a dozen people, VR on-line can house millions.<P>

<FONT SIZE=5>Memory versus intelligence</FONT><P>

Let us compare two cognitive operations, one private, the other collective.
When you think privately, or when you picture something in your mind, you
focus your attention inward and what you "see" or work into at the other
end of your attention is a more or less unified but flexible image or group
of thoughts. There is no particular "place" for the object of your
attention, but you cannot deny that it is "there" somehow. It seems to be
at some central point, slightly forward, and slightly below eye level in
your mind/brain . The image is suspended somehow not visibly grounded in
anything but the immediate context that has required its formation. This
suspended field, the thought,  is the object of focus. Likewise, the object
of focus of a network is the collaborative work that goes into it.<P>

Networked communications bring different people simultaneously in
collective thinking by making them all enter in the same suspended field of
networked activities. The time-frame of this suspension is different from
the time-frame of the private mind's thought. It is extended time, hence
accomodating for the different moments of inputs by different people in the
same collective thinking. Extended time is not simultaneous time, it is
comprehensive time. It takes all the elements of succession in all
directions in a single grasp. That is how and why a collective working out
of thought can take its sources in simultaneous and successive myriads of
"hits", just as the thought or the image in the brain instantly connects
millions of interconnections.<P>

The centrality and communality of this suspended field may not always be
apparent, especially when it is only text-based (e.g. with MOOs and MUDs).
However, if there is a common image that every participant shares, for
example a groupware screen for collaborative work at a distance, then the
paradoxical communality of the object of attention appears quite readily.
Each participant's screen becomes a portal and a support to the unified
collective thinking. More and more Net artists could be tempted to explore
the psychological consequences of this new cognitive situation.<P>

Here is an example of a site which may not be considered as an artform
today, but which might someday be remembered as one: <A HREF =
"http://www.worlds.net/info/aboutus.html">Knowledge Adventure Worlds</A>.
When you register on the site, you are invited to download a few megabits
of structured data in your hard drive. You thereby acquire the
decor and the costumes of a virtual meeting place for actual meetings. For
those in the know, it is not much more than an illustrated MOO where people
meet by writing and create plots and places and objects with words. But
there lies all the difference. Words are not the thing itself, the image is
(at least in this case). Nobody noticed when we only had MOOs that the
space of communication was unified in a single collective mental
environment. When you share exactly the same space  with dozens of people
landing there from all over the world at the same time, you have the
necessary continuity of data to help you perceive the unity of substance.
To make another comparison from another angle, take CU-SeeMe, for instance
(by all standards still a pretty rough substitute for live
videoconferencing): it is not the fact that, for the moment, the presence
of your interlocutor is chopped into slides by a slow-scan TV effect, it is
the fact that you see the different locale of your interlocutor which makes
it impossible for you to equate both spaces. With imagined space, that is
possible because the main elements of the imagination are made to be
common. That innovation is about as powerful and artistic as Cervant¶s' Don
Quixotte who tried to bring our attention to the fact that reading novels
could fills so much of our mind as to replace it with their own space.<P>

As Nicolas Negroponte emphasized in Being Digital, with networked
communications, the processing conditions for information are rapidly
shifting from "atoms to bits", that is from hardware to software, from
permanent analog to labile numerical supports. The most important
characteristic of data on-line is that it is digital. Not only because
reducing every difference to 0/1 facilitates their shuffling around, but
because this very flexibility makes matter, once perceived as consisting of
mutually heterogenous and impenetrable substances, seems now as fluid as
thought itself. It is a fact that while all the supports of information of
the past are supports of memory (books, tapes, records, films, videos,
photographies), the main technologies of today's information systems are
supports of processing, that is intelligence. This shift is nothing less
than a much larger shift of the culture from memory-based to
intelligence-based processing. Soon we will not have to "live" history, we
can simply think it ahead.<P>

<FONT SIZE=5>Artforms as thoughtforms</FONT><P>

This shift has profound implications for artwork in the new culture arising
from networked communications. Because of it, a significant part of the art
conceived and proposed on-line has abandoned the "object" fixation for
process-based activities. While traditional art activities addressed
cognitive and emotional responses through the use of objects or spectacular
performances, art on the Net puts the effects before the cause, so to
speak, and addresses cognition directly in the interactive process which
makes every user a partner in the artistic process. Indeed, the notion of
"art on the Net" takes a fuller meaning when the Net itself is used as
prime material for the artform. Among the esthetic qualities specific to
networked communications are "webness" and "metadesign".<P>

Webness, a term coined by the jurors of the Art on the Web category for the
1995 Ars Electronica Prize, points to a character that is quite specific to
the properties of the World Wide Web. While the Internet by itself is
endowed with a moderate degree of webness, the World Wide Web is
incrementially more "webby" because it adds hypertextual links to
ubiquitous targeted communication. Compare e-mail which allows you to
communicate one-to-one or one-to-many in a star-shaped formation, with
Hypermail which adds instantly self-adjusting links within your message.
The webness of Hypermail is the interconnectivity that links thinking
sources in a durable network of specifically addressed connections. Webness
means interconnecting live human intelligences by purposely conceived
collective interfaces for self-adjusting innovations and discoveries.
Something like a collective thinking in slow motion is happening out there.
A linked web is structured like a liquid crystal, always reconfiguring
itself without losing its molecular identity. Webness is also an esthetic
criterium in that there is beauty in patterns and quality of
interconnections .  Webness in art means that the artform uses the Net for
its interactive properties rather than simply as a vehicle for promoting
content.<P>

<A HREF = "http://www.artcom.de">Art + Com</A>'s T-Vision is perhaps one of
the prime candidates for today's
best interpretations of webness. Although it was granted the prize for the
artform with the most significant potential impact on society at the 1995
Interactive Media Festival in Los Angles, it is not quite out on the Net
yet. It consists in the projection of planet Earth on a screen in 3-D   .
With a flying mouse, you can change your point-of-view from outer space all
the way down-to-earth and even land at a site where, live via ATM or the
Net, you can see what a video camera is looking at. The point is that it is
possible to imagine that, like Virtual Tourist, but in a much more
sophisticated way, we could address ourselves anywhere on the globe and
land there in a live contact. Beam me over, Scotty. T-Vision is perhaps the
Net's next stage because it is the interface by excellence that
interiorizes for each one of us our new body image, that of the globe
itself. With the foreseable rapid growth of ATM, we may soon have a
Macro-Web with the most urgent interface we could ever hope for. T-Vision
is without question one of the most important creations for the on-line
communities short of the invention of the Web itself.<P>

Metadesign is another major characteristic of art on-line which comes with
the territory of interactivity. It is the kind of design that puts the
tools rather than the object of design in your hands. The better
interactive systems are not those which define the process, but those which
define the conditions for the process of the interaction. The more tools
are in the hands of the user to shape, specify and control the interaction,
the more interactive it will be. In that sense, CD-Roms like Burn Cycle or
<A HREF =
"http://www.spe.sony.com/Pictures/SonyMovies/06jonmnu.html">Johnny
Mnemonic</A>, as great works as they are, are not very interactive,
while David Blair's <A HREF =
"http://bug.village.virginia.edu/">WaxWeb</A>, as excruciatingly slow as it
is, is very
interactive. We can expect a great increase of metadesign possibilities in
VRML (Virtual Reality Markup Language) over HTML, the first generation
language of collective knowledge tools. The advance of VRML over HTML is as
significant as that of hypermail over e-mail. The difference is that
instead of dealing with webbed words, we are beginning to learn to deal
with webbed worlds.<P>

The art of the Web is the art of collective thoughtform, shared
hallucination for some, real live experience for others. In Tarkowski's
magnificently haunting Sci-Fi film, Solaris, a team of astronauts falls
under the influence of a unknown planet which projects objective thoughts
in the shapes of objects and people that the participants believe to be
real.  Thoughts and shapes on the Net are much more real than that. Here
are a few examples...<P>

<FONT SIZE=5>A collective tastebud</FONT><P>

<A HREF = "http://www.agents-inc.com">HOMR</A>, otherwise known as Ringo ++
by Patti Maes et al., is a site which
allows you to specify with some accuracy your musical tastes when you
register. A few seconds after completing a simple but compelling
questionnaire, you get a series of recommendations for what other musical
pieces you  might like, and which ones to avoid. So far, this seems not
much more than a rather astute marketing tool making good use of the
interactive potential of the Web. Press another button and you now get a
statistical profile of the number of people who share your taste presented
in a decreasing order of communality. As an added service, you can, in some
cases, obtain the e-mail addresses of the people who have the musical
tastes which are relevant to you. Again, this is not an artform per se
except that, as an esthetic and building tool for real-time actual
communities, it is a new concept in sensory design: a collective tastebud.<P>

<FONT SIZE=5>Reversing repression</FONT><P>

Antoni Muntadas' <A HREF =
"http://fileroom.aaup.uic.edu/FileRoom/documents/homepage.html">The File
Room</A> is at first glance a kind of politicized
community watchdog service: it gives access to whoever logs on to as many
censored files on art and politics as Muntadas and his team could find to
scan, process or digitize from the time of Cleopatra to the present. As a
database, it is just "classified" content, but, as a support for a
collective mind community, it is a huge collective social service making
the objects of repression, permanent evidence for investigation. The
artistic element is to attempt to reverse the process of repression by
accumulating the body of evidence in a single mind-based environment, a
collective lore accessible as "objective" data by anyone.<P>

<FONT SIZE=5>Problems of identity</FONT><P>

Many critics of the Net get very worked up over the issue that the markings
of individual identity can be made to disappear completely save whatever it
is that the user cares to put out there. People don't bother with the much
more interesting question of what identity to give to a collective on-line.
Linda Dement's Cyberflesh Girlmonster addresses precisely that question by
creating a composition of a woman made by the assembled body parts of her
friends photographed and scanned into the system. Just in case you would
think that it just a representation and no more, before you discount the
possibility that such bizarre melanges would ever affect you directly,
consider <A HREF = "http://www.merlin.com.au/stelarc/">Stelarc</A> or
Luciana Haill's projects. Stelarc is working on
down-loading in real-time the pulse and beat of his nervous system on-line
so that somebody else's arms and legs connected through the appropriate
interface can execute a danse neurophysiologically willed at the other side
of the planet (Australia, for example). What is the collective identity of
a siamese twin ?<P>

Luciana Haill's project is even more complex and intimate: she plans to use
an improved version of Kahata's Interactive Brainwave Visual Analyser
(IBVA) to download her brainwave patterns on the Net and mix them up in an
orderly fashion with other participants's brainwave patterns so as to
generate an interactive display that would be the combination of hers and
the other people's thinking. That has webness and metadesign in it.<P>

About the "virtualness" of virtual communities
Among the virtual worlds similar to Knowledge Adventure Worlds that have
not quite made it on-line yet, but hold great promises once they do is <A
HREF = "http://www.nta.no/telektronikk/4.93.dir/Loeffler_C_E.html">Carl
Loeffler</A>'s Virtual Polis, a virtual community environment which allows
you
to access your personally designed virtual appartment complete with a
virtual wardrobe stored in virtual drawers and bought at a virtual shopping
mall next to a virtual amusement park in the virtual neighborhood. At some
point in the not to distant future, you will be able to don these clothes
to meet real partners also dressed up virtually for business or seduction
or any other purpose you care to meet for. In such environments, everything
is indeed "virtual", except that the people who meet there are "real".
Similarly, the T&eacute;l&eacute;virtualit&eacute; project at the Institut
National d'Audiovisuel in Paris allows people to entertain real-time
conferences on
line, but with a lip and facial expression graphic rendering synchronized
with their real speech and expression movements registered by an on-site
camera.<P>

Hence, there is much more than virtualness about on-line communities which
are made of real people, really involved with each other, but who can do a
lot more "real" things together than with the telephone. Did the
development of phone-in habits in speakerphone conferences or live radio
and TV shows ever bring up the notion of virtuality ? Telephone, videophone
and on-line communications have much more to do with telepresence than
virtuality, that is with actual presence, than with virtual experience. The
fact that it is now also possible to add virtual experiences via on-line
communications shouldn't incline us to forget that it is the reality and
the targeted pertinence of on-line communication that is its principal
characteristic. To that extent, what is exceptional about the on-line
community is that it retains a body and the mark of your input even when
you are off-line. The so-called "virtual" community is not only a large
number of people more or less directly, more or less constantly involved in
a common activity. It is also a real-time immediate and contingent
presence, like a mind at work during its work.<P>

On-line communications have created a new kind of permanence, a new
stability of mind, a collective mind, in which one plugs in or from which
one pulls out, but without affecting the integrity of the structure other
than by direct contribution. Somewhere, in netherspace, there stands a body
of evidence, constituted by an absolutely precise and recorded network,
with inputs and outputs all over the world. These collectives of
"mind-at-work" are active, learning, self-organizing and thereby growing in
size and precision. So, let us assume that these new states of mind, states
that have both the permanence and the flexibility of liquid crystals, are a
reality. They are right there, here, now, and growing. Many among us know,
others guess that the whole culture is moving to that condition, a fact
made all the more certain when we see that business and government are now
looking at all of this with hungry eyes. There is an urgent need for
artists to explore this new psychological condition, so that they can begin
to prepare the antidotes to potential traumas, and reveal the extent of the
new possibilities that we are offered.</FONT>
