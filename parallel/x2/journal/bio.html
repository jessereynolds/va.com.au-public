<FONT SIZE=5>"The rapid development of art on the Net is one more proof
that artists are among the first people to use new media and make them
perceivable as environments open to more than utilitarian and functional
use. One of the roles of art addressing technological transformation is to
bring out the human content, the metaphorical over and above the functional
or litteral value of the unfolding technological environment. In times of
great
structural changes of the collective mind, the artist's job is to make
people aware of such changes and create the new decors and sensory
experiences afforded by them. ..."</FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>The star is the (a) thing; the fetish over the heart, the
intersection. From Noon to Dusk, and in between the trouble of the star.
For Ulmer one star, for Walker another, and the spoken as double
(theory).</FONT><BR><P>

<FONT SIZE=5>An etymological and metaphorical tracking of ideas related to
body, city and community.  Sidetracks through matter, liminality and the
shimmering borders of darkness.  A tentative charting of urbanity as the
site wherein community comes to presence as exposed and brimming.  The
piece inclines to Heidegger, Nancy and Agamben.</FONT><BR><P>

<FONT SIZE=5>As phantasy recognizes power's sites, the erotics of
complicity find an
ambience inside descriptive convention. This writing produces itself within
such ambiguous folds, or ripples rather, since the place that is the centre
moves kinetically across language. Phatic shows the descriptive surface as
hopeful, impossible: cleft.</FONT><BR><P>

<FONT SIZE=5>How does the natural world look through an imagination of the
bowels? By exploring notions of the stomach and digestive processes, of the
body's nervous system, of healthy diet, this paper tries to imagine a
plurality of gut-centred perspectives towards landscape, identity, and
nature. It draws on ancient ideas about a vegetable soul, as well as modern
dreams and literature.</FONT><BR><P>

<FONT SIZE=5>There are stories about aliens and there are stories which are
alien. Alien
may mean strange and  foreign  in content, structure and  form. Alien
stories may be   composed with  multiple examples of a  'true foreign'.
They may be   connected with   local and international  technologies of
self-formation.  They may also be fragments of the imagination.</FONT><BR><P>
