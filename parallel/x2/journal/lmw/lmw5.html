<TT><FONT SIZE=5><BLOCKQUOTE>The first movie I remember, recall scenes from, is My Fair Lady. It was my first movie in a cinema, and my first visit to a city. The cinema, in the next town, had burned down. I saw movies at the Drive-In, arriving around <a href="../gregory_ulmer/desire1.html">DUSK</a>. I never took much <a href="lmw6.html">notice</a> of Westerns. Although Country & Western music was a big thing in my family, especially Hank Williams.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></TT>
