<TT><FONT SIZE=5><BLOCKQUOTE>(<a href="">Pause</a>) There are voices. The voices are slow and soft and very close. (<a href="../gregory_ulmer/desire.html">Pause</a>) The light is low. The light slowly brightens, but is never very bright. (<a href="lmw5.html">Hesitating</a>) A white building, tables, chairs, wooden, comfortable, dark green walls, music in the background, slow jazz, several low ceiling fans, one working, one window, no curtain. A sky. Quiet, few distant noises. No wind. Nothing moves.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></TT>
