Agamben, G.   <B>The Coming Community</B>: 67: "the notion of the 'outside'
is expressed in many European languages by a word that means 'at the door'
(<I>fores</I> in Latin is the door of the house, <I>thyrathen</I> in Greek
literally means 'at the threshold').   The <I>outside</I> is not another
space that resides beyond a determined space, but rather it is the passage,
the exteriority that gives it access - in a word, it is its face, its
<I>eidos</I>.   The threshold is not, in this sense, another thing with
respect to the limit; it is, so to speak, the experience of the limit
itself, the experience of being-<I>within</I> an <I>outside</I>.   This
<I>ek-stasis</I> is the gift that singularity gathers from the empty hand
of humanity."  See Heidegger, M.  <I>Building dwelling thinking</I>: 154 -
<I>"A boundary is not that at which something stops but, as the Greeks
recognised, the boundary is that from which something begins its
presencing".</I>
