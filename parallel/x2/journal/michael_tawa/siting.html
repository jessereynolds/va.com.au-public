<FONT SIZE=4>body
<p>The body bids, bodes: awakens to what abides - to what, (embedded),
resides and desires to speak - to whatever, of being, bodes. Speaking,
(opening), full and flushed, it bellows: hollow, belly, womb; bower.
Interior space, receptacle, habitation - the body places dwelling, harbours
refuge. Separate, detached (distributed in parts) - the body localises
interiority, and interiorises locality.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot02.html">2</a>)</font>

<p>Is the body a garden? A garden girt by yarns, made by speaking. Court,
yard - cord, yarn; choir, chorus; khora. The space of the body - from which
(in which, of which) it speaks - is a gaping (raw wound - cruel, bloody)
yawn, cosmic abyss, orchard, field, house. An effortlessly opening and
extending, containing and receiving envelope - but light; an organic
vestment - a gossamer gown.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot03.html">3</a>)</font>

<p>The body is curvature: concavity, convexity. Covert, dug, its vault
harbours, contains, secrets - arched-up, its vault, lofty, secretes. What?
The expired corpse: a grave, closed to sense, shut. A crypt, an excavation:
empty - (not as devoid but brimming) - yielding inexhaustible profusion.
The body - exposed at its limits, at its (b)rim - bridges, joins,
gathers.<font size=3>(<a href="foot04.html">4</a>)</font> What? The
unsounded-sounded, the unmeasured-measured, the inner-outer.<font
size=3>(<a href="foot05.html">5</a>)</font> The body matters: it "always
weighs; it lets itself weigh, be weighed. It presses, it presses against
other bodies, onto other bodies. All bodies weigh against one another....
This is not a matter of mechanics or gravity. Bodies weigh lightly. Their
weight is the rising of their mass to their surface. Endlessly, the mass
rises to the surface, and peels off as a surface."<font size=3>(<a
href="foot06.html">6</a>)</font>

<p>Between outside and inside, at the rim, and ambiguous border (where,
also, an expulsion of the abject takes place<font size=3>(<a
href="foot07.html">7</a>)</font>) - flesh swells and is leavened. Its
swelling is a ferment, a yielding agreement: yes. What swells at the rim is
the residue - a remainder: that portion over and above, the surplus. A
supplement that is everything, that is the All: all-productive and
all-liberating font, navel and nave, (origin and means), of arising
measure.<font size=3>(<a href="foot08.html">8</a>)</font>

<p>Somatic, the body is sound - which is to say saved, delivered, rescued;
which is to say sane, sober, temperate: a sign of fellowship, a community
of parts, a token of joint membership.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot09.html">9</a>)</font> The body is never solitary - a lone body.
Its somatology is a site of incarnation, of knowing - where gnosis takes
place as a turning, which is ruination.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot10.html">10</a>)</font> An effigy devoid of vitality: a carcass,
fallen<font size=3>(<a href="foot11.html">11</a>)</font> - fallen around
that ruination that turns on the suppleness of its articulated mobility,
its arcuated force. <font size=3>(<a href="foot12.html">12</a>)</font>

<p>The body is that breathed-upon and breathing: raised in being brought to
resonance, to in-spired speech.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot13.html">13</a>)</font> Its bony substance binds, strengthens,
confirms. The body is tree, trunk, wooden spine: druidic oak. Elemental
strength, it stands as aggregating power of increase and accumulation:
matter in the process of working - matter making present its extensity,
invasively; determined growing to the terms and the conditions of its
terminality - through, into its limits. Is it (finished?, or) consummated
in transcendence.<font size=3>(<a href="foot14.html">14</a>)</font>

sky
<p>What of darkness and light? The darkness of creation<font size=3>(<a
href="foot15.html">15</a>)</font> - from which God speaks out of the midst
of the fire, the cloud, and the deep gloom - is a restraining obscurity.
Withholding, refraining; a sparing of light - kept spare, kept as a
supplement: over and above - which is to say in the readiness that attends
to necessity. The withholding is an in-folding that weaves and plaits the
purposed - that fabricates in light-withheld. This self-absorbing obscurity
is ringed with fire: its complexion sparkles, scintillates, shimmers love;
and its incandescent skin - skeined darkly and withheld - is a distending
ardour of arcane fire. Darkness is the impossibility of circumscribing the
transcendent: that stammering which is speech disposed to come to a
stand-still before the immanent and the inexpressible - and yet cannot-not
speak.<font size=3>(<a href="foot16.html">16</a>)</font>

<p>Likewise, the darkness in which God dwells<font size=3>(<a
href="foot17.html">17</a>)</font> - shade, shadow and terrifying mark<font
size=3>(<a href="foot18.html">18</a>)</font> - is a gloom attending a
lowering sky thick with inclining clouds. This darkness, which is absolute
lack - which is utter blindness and privation - is ringed by fire, and
lightning: the passion of internal ardour striking the obscurity and
cryptic concealment of matter. <font size=3>(<a
href="foot19.html">19</a>)</font> This sheer darkness shines. <font
size=3>(<a href="foot20.html">20</a>)</font>

<p>Night is not; a knot - naught. But also a node - a mark or notch by
which something is named, made known; by which something is brought to
notice and mapped - by which it is knitted, bound and fastened - by which
it escapes no-thingness. The node is a locus of motion without term: a
pulsation barely held from desegregation. Its escape is its turning into
itself - an indefinitely prolonged intension even as it distends without
term: in which nocturnal conjunction, expansion and contraction tend and
incline to adherence.<font size=3>(<a href="foot21.html">21</a>)</font>

<p><center><img src="graphics/4a.jpg" alt="4a"><img src="graphics/4b.jpg"
alt="4b">
</center>

<p>Light is produced in this lack that is excess - this desire delivered to
intrinsic ardour as sign of convertibility: being/non-being, the
being-in-act - the Irreparable.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot22.html">22</a>)</font> It's lustration is lucid - but also
lunatic, luciferian (creation is the given as loss, as gift). It's ligation
- its ligneous function - is ornamentation. It legislates the ligatures and
adornment of order: gleaming seams and sutures, (adoring), sounding: Logos,
Fiat Lux.<font size=3>(<a href="foot23.html">23</a>)</font>

<p>The sun rays its self-consumption. Its shimmer is duplicitous: it
re-pleats and doubles. On a scintillating boundary that is the
name-made-known - that is begotten resonance brought-forth through absolute
darkness, and resounding - that shimmer stammers.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot24.html">24</a>)</font>

(scale)
<p>A ladder links and distends the separate. Lesion and release. (What is
lost in giving? - given in loss?) Proportion is all that - relationally -
increases, extends, escalates: all that arises to the surface, as surface.
To scale is to cut - to cleave, section-apart, differentiate, discriminate
- to shed. A shedding is a peeling-off: to shear and shave, to scrape (back
again) - to reveal the segmented: a shorn scarp (or scalp) one scales -
scanned and skinned. Skin is touch<font size=3>(<a
href="foot25.html">25</a>)</font> - and touch is the sensibility of
community: its inclining and weighing-upon itself.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot26.html">26</a>)</font> Skin shades and shelters: a shining sky,
obscuring. Skin harbours the furrowed - where matter is cooked and hewn
crooked - where matter skews hollow and curved: a bowl for weighing and
measuring, a curved shell, a firmamental canopy.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot27.html">27</a>)</font>

matter
<p>Matter is riddled with stresses, streaks, strains. It maps sites of
slippage, swelling, constriction, tenuousness. We name these fault lines
because we privilege the seamless. These seams of matter, these sites of
frailty, of weakness - where it is unstrung, where it surrenders - heave
open to a gleaming of the incandescent.

<p>Matter is (archaically) woody: a ligneous matrix. It prostrates and
fields a plane prepared for deployment: for measure to be meted-out,
modulated, mediated.<font size=3>(<a href="foot28.html">28</a>)</font>
Measure is properly extension: the divided as intervaled-apart - as
difference twice-voided within the midst and schism of the same. This
stretched interval renders the homogenous void - and in that violation,
nullifies it and negates it from within.

<p><center><img src="graphics/7a.jpg" alt="7a"><img src="graphics/7b.jpg"
alt="7b">
</center>

<p>What is made room for in this partedness is a vesical matrix in which
mind means to become as labyrinthine deployment<font size=3>(<a
href="foot29.html">29</a>)</font>: as the impulse of matter willing to
rise-forth in multiplicity.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot30.html">30</a>)</font> The matrix be-holds mensuration as fluid
power - as an agitation marking passage to satiation at the term<font
size=3>(<a href="foot31.html">31</a>)</font>, to a terminal trespass that
is abundance in abandonment.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot32.html">32</a>)</font>

place
<p>Place is a standing: a locality that wells-forth and arises, abiding as
performance - as the state and stature of an ordination, accomplished and
set-up. Place consists of what subsists as issuing-forth, as taking-place
and springing into placedness. It is matter substantialised and brought to
consolidated persistence: the collective measuring-forth and interlacing of
indefinitely extensive matter.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot33.html">33</a>)</font> Place is peopled, occupied, claimed and
given to opportunity. <font size=3>(<a href="foot34.html">34</a>)</font>
Inhabited and shadowing dwelling, exposed, its tracts track the
coming-to-be and the taking-place of whatever-being, here and now. <font
size=3>(<a href="foot35.html">35</a>)</font>

<p>On the one hand a sedative: sinking to rest, subsiding, sedimentation.
To site is to settle (a quarrel), to make peace, to reconcile to a
satisfactory state. On the other a sedition: scattering, sowing apart, a
seeding, a seduction. The seat (the throne) is a trap.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot36.html">36</a>)</font>

<p>To stand is to stand-fast, to be placed and to have a place. To stand
placed is to remain in good stead, settled; but also in-stead, instead-of,
in the place of community. This standing is a steership. That which stands
fast is a stowage. Steering, the rudder stands pivotal, tracking firm
course. What is stowed is the unfurling, (like a shuttle infiltrating a
standing warp), which, in that coursing, constructs and restores the
steadfastness of place and the placedness of community.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot37.html">37</a>)</font>

<p>To set a place is to make room for; to settle and set-forth a dwelling -
a coming-to-be-here and a coming-to-be-now fit for whoever happens to stand
in the midst. To place is to set-forth in community. To set a place is to
settle from out of a wandering. This settling is not down, in inertia - but
about, in community. Fixed, not in location - but in intention. The place
assigned ("prepared for you from the foundation of the world"<font
size=3>(<a href="foot38.html">38</a>)</font>), this assisted settling, is a
setting in place assigned to a founding: to a laying hold that yields, a
seizing of the only sufficiency - the satiation: the what-is-enough. That
portion appointed as provision, as stowage, asset, standing reserve<font
size=3>(<a href="foot39.html">39</a>)</font>. To settle is be seated and to
sit at table - at or near - to sit beside another, within community.

polis
<p>The city is community, summoned and hastened to citizenship. Citizenship
is dwelling as a waking or a watch. The urbane is one who watches, who
remains open - one bare and exposed. What to? To a surveillance that
watches-over and surveys. Neither disengaged nor panoptic, but an attending
to the dwelling and rising-up of community. Not rising up in revolt as a
directed-elsewhere, but a suffusing emergence of that watching that wakes
over the exposed.<font size=3>(<a href="foot40.html">40</a>)</font>

<p>To attend to is to lean towards, to incline, to desire, to tend. That
which is attended to watchfully is given corporately to community. What is
done together gathers and opens community to that attentiveness - to that
attending to what comes, to what enters in. This waking is a giving way - a
surrender. It attends to an increase in which what comes grows and is
witnessed waxing. This watching builds. It lights-upon - and in that
brings-about or forth, brings near-to or approaches, the there-in of a
neighbourhood - not only a near-dweller<font size=3>(<a
href="foot41.html">41</a>)</font> but also a nigh-dweller: a kinsfolk whose
dwelling is nigh; as impending or up-coming<font size=3>(<a
href="foot42.html">42</a>)</font> - as an effortless dwelling in the waking
in which something is wrought.

<p>Citizenship is polity: attending to conversation, to engagement, to the
condition of exchange and discourse - to the agonic that is game and
warfare.<font size=3>(<a href="foot43.html">43</a>)</font> The city is
community exposed. It's skin is that of surveillance. The city (graven and
engraved; penetrant cold<font size=3>(<a href="foot44.html">44</a>)</font>
) incites a watching that wakes over the adversary - with hostilities, with
warfare never far. The city pollulates. Its plurality is surfeit, fullness:
pleroma.<font size=3>(<a href="foot45.html">45</a>)</font> The city
pollutes - its surface is filth, putrid and foul. Its over-muchness is
decay, desegregation and rot.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot46.html">46</a>)</font> Paddled into confusion and promiscuity -
pillaged and pell-mell - it stinks.<font size=3>(<a
href="foot47.html">47</a>)</font>

<p><center><img src="graphics/10a.jpg" alt="10a"><img
src="graphics/10b.jpg" alt="10b">
</center>
<p>On this watching, community is hinged and unhinged: in motion - as
motion around the poles, fastened - it is driven, pulsing. As driven, it is
flayed and exposed raw - dilapidated - its pelt, peeled, glints.<font
size=3>(<a href="foot48.html">48</a>)</font> Pollinating, it pulverises -
pinched and pounded like fine flour, sifted meal, chaff - pallid and beyond
the pale, scraped-back again, grey and appalling: a palimpsest. A palisade
stakes it out and forecloses territory - the palings impale and stake its
limits<font size=3>(<a href="foot49.html">49</a>)</font> ; always at stake
and staked on the watching that unhinges - that skins and exposes it at the
rim, at the boundary: this limit that is a gate kept and surveyed by
community.<font size=3>(<a href="foot50.html">50</a>)</font>

Michael Tawa is an architect and senior lecturer in architecture at the
School of Architecture, University of NSW, where he teaches design theory,
architectural design and technology.  A Doctorate (1991) on the
relationships between music and architecture using Pythagorean, Platonic
and Vedic sources, led to an ongoing interest in hermeneutics.  He is now
working on notions of mapping and their implications for design
practice.</FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE>
