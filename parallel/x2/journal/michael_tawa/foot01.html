footnote 1</FONT></B><P>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=4><p>This piece is written as speech and as performance.   In
it, etymology is used <I>liberally</I> to prise open and <I>multiply</I>
possibilities of interpretation.
<P></P>
These are intended to <I>pollulate</I> rather than cohere; and to resonate
<I>between</I> rather than <I>in</I> the words themselves.   These
resonances have conceptual configurations - but they are also contours of
techtonic probabilities, and are offered as such.<p>
As word-games, they are in the manner of play and trope - and their lineage
stretches from Vedic hermeneutics and <I>nirukta;</I> through Plato; to the
hermeneutic methods adopted by Heidegger and Derrida for example.   <P>
Etymologies are drawn from Skeat, W.  W.  <B>Etymological Dictionary of the
English Language</B>.  Oxford, 1978; Strong, J.  <B>The Exhaustive
Concordance of the Bible</B>.  Riverside.  Iowa Falls (undated); and
D'Olivet, F.  <B>La Langue Hébraïque Restituée</B>.  Delphica.  L'Age
D'Homme.  Vevey, 1985.<P>   <FONT SIZE=3><B>Etymological roots are
indicated by the sign &ccedil;.<P>
Language groups are as follows: SKT: Sanscrt; E: Egyptian; HB: Hebrew; GK:
Greek; L: Latin; AS: Anglo Saxon; ME: Middle English;  OHG: Old High
German; G: German; OFR: Old French; FR: French; IT: Italian; ICL:
Icelandic; N: Nordic; SW: Swedish.</B></FONT>
