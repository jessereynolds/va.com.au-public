1 This piece is written as speech and as performance.   In it, etymology is used liberally to prise open and multiply possibilities of interpretation.   These are intended to pollulate rather than cohere; and to resonate between rather than in the words themselves.   These resonances have conceptual configurations - but they are also contours of techtonic probabilities, and are offered as such.   As word-games, they are in the manner of play and trope - and their lineage stretches from Vedic hermeneutics and nirukta; through Plato; to the hermeneutic methods adopted by Heidegger and Derrida for example.   Etymologies are drawn from Skeat, W.  W.  Etymological Dictionary of the English Language.  Oxford,, 1978; Strong, J.  The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible.  Riverside.  Iowa Falls (undated); and D’Olivet, F.  La Langue Hébraïque Restituée.  Delphica.  L’Age D’Homme.  Vevey, 1985.   Etymological roots are indicated by the sign <B>&ccedil;</B>.

The Coming Community: 54-55 - “This imperceptible trembling of the finite that makes its limits indeterminate and allows it to blend, to make itself whatever, is the tiny displacement that everything must accomplish in the messianic world.

See Agamben, G.   The Coming Community: 67: “the notion of the “outside” is expressed in many European languages by a word that means “at the door” (fores in Latin is the door of the house, thyrathen in Greek literally means “at the threshold”).   The outside is not another space that resides beyond a determined space, but rather it is the passage, the exteriority that gives it access - in a word, it is its face, its eidos.   The threshold is not, in this sense, another thing with respect to the limit; it is, so to speak, the experience of the limit itself, the experience of being-within an outside.   This ek-stasis is the gift that singularity gathers from the empty hand of humanity.”  See Heidegger, M.  Building dwelling thinking: 154 - “A boundary is not that at which something stops but, as the Greeks recognised, the boundary is that from which something begins its presencing”.
