Hello? Hello?
You hung up! 
Why won’t you talk to me?
I don’t understand, we talked
about this only yesterday.
I thought we were friends.
I thought, I don’t know,
what I was thinking.
Why won’t you answer?
You . . .
Well, I can’t answer this,
I just want to walk with you.
You can’t walk, you can’t talk to me.
You can’t? You won’t.
Should I talk like this all night?
What did I do?
What did I do?
What happened?
Where are you going?
What is happening?
I told you so.
I want to say everything,
I want you to hear,
what have I said, or stinky is it?
Where is everything?
I have such a headache now,
and such a lot of anger.
Angry at you, angry at Elvis,
angry at The Apple, you're choking me.
You're making me blow up.
I'm going to smash.
I dreamed about you, I saw you
at a Days Inn. You were glowing,
and I saw your left arm, and
part of your face. You were spinning
around real fast, like an old record,
and the veins in your neck were
bulging, and when the maids
came around to vacuum, they
skipped where you were, where
you'd been standing and where I
saw you. Then later, the maids'
boss came around and saw you,
and he sucked you away, down
into the incinerator where all
the floating boats and bare-headed
Darth Vaders sit around poking
ashes looking for shit to do.
A few paces back and you found
all the burned books from Alabama,
that Linus is gay, and so is
Peppermint Patty.
How long will your fucking
answering machine let me talk?
How deep is this? How sorry are you?
Oh, no, this is terrible. 
I want to know something. Hold it!
Hold it! Can you stop this? Can
anything ever happen to me?
