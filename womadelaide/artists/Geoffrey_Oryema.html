<p>A return performance by a star of WOMADELAIDE 93. As a soloist, <B>Geoffrey Oryema</B> captivated audiences with his impassioned songs of Exile, sung in the language of his youth (Swahili and Acoli) and accompanied by the haunting sounds of the lukeme (thumb piano). Oryema returns to Adelaide with a full backing band, introducing audiences to the music of his latest release 'Beat the Border'. His current work is of universal appeal, with many songs written in English. While still playing traditional instruments, Oryema creates a unique sound blending pop-rock roots with the strong influences of his Ugandan heritage - a style which has won him critical acclaim throughout Europe and the US.
