<p><b>Weighting for Data has now closed at the Adelaide Festival Centre. Look out for it at a venue near you sometime soon!</b></p>
<!-- <p><table border=0><tr><td><img height=240 width=320 src="http://203.15.106.201:81"></td>
<td><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Sans-Serif"><p><b>left:</b> live view from the side of weightybot looking downwards (requires Netscape Navigator or other server-push compatible browser). <b>below:</b> still photo of weightybot</p>
<p><b>Instructions:</b> weightybot pulls itself up and down via a pulley system hanging from the ceiling. you can adjust it's relative weight by adding or removing files from it via FTP. So, configure an FTP client to connect as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>host:</b> <tt>weightybot.va.com.au</tt>
<li><b>username:</b> <tt>weighty</tt>
<li><b>password:</b> <tt>weighty</tt>
<li><b>transfer mode:</b> <tt>active (NOT passive)</tt>
<li><b>directory:</b> <tt>/Pokey/weighty</tt>
</ul>
<p>then you are free to upload your own files, download whatever is there that interests you, or delete files at random (please don't just delete for the sake of it)</p>

<p> Weighting for Data investigates the interaction of the real and the virtual by providing an interface that assumes data has mass. Viewers may wander beneath the Mac SE 30 as it rises and falls, depending on how full it's hard disk is. Online viewers may alter the effective weight of the unit by copying files to it's hard disk and by deleting files. Online visitors also see a live video image from the SE 30's onboard webcam.</p>
